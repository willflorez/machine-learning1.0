Luckily, you don't have to reverse park it but you get extra points if you do cause it is bloody hard. But this is suprisingly a nice truck driving game and I had a bit of fun with it.\"},\n",

No need to play the first game, its nicely wrapped up for you in a five minute video. FYI beware of the sex scenes :P, nudity does happen in the game and it shows you actually having sex, so try not to play with your parents around if your near a point in the story. Also you will need a good rig/comp to play on high. Don't even try running the game on Ultra unless you have mulitiple GPU's (Graphics card) and ram and a good processor. All in all good game :D\"},\n",

But since its release in July 2011, it grown to become an outstanding example of Enthusiasm, Humor, and Profound triamph in a game. No matter whether your accomplishing great feats of exploration and scientific achievement......Or maybe you watched your beloved ship erupt into flames and debris becuase of a fatally unseen flaw. There is always something spectacular to be seen (Like your blown-up ship) or something to have a laugh at (Again like your blown-up ship)My recommendation?Buy this game, do something great, do something ridiculous, mod it, find something else just as great and just as crazy to do. My little tip is that i get emotionally attatched to some of my kerbals (Especially Jebediah). There's so much fun to be had and tenderness to experience. There's no reason not to buy this game and experience it. So do it!!!\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"I've always liked games like Terraria with the 2 dimensional survival and exploration aspect and Starbound does all these well and MORE!Lets start with its soundtrack: To sum it up in one paragraph would do it injustice. This games soundtrack is fully orchestral and imersive. The music just fits perfectly where-ever you are in game. Whether you are spelunking or just flying through the vast expanse of space it fits perfectly and leaves you in awe.Ok onto the graphics: The look and feel of this game bring the vast worlds to life with the many colors and alien dirts, trees and the mixture of monsters. The backgrounds of the planets match up the the foregrounds well and give the 2d aspect that 3d feel.Now the gameplay: Starbound has a nice rich layer of gameplay revolving around survival. In the latest unstable build updates they have introduced a very needed layer of missions and npc quests which fullfil the gaps of just flying from planet to planet and give purpose.Starbounds worlds have a wide variety of random aspects to them.First off the flora: Flora of planets consists of 2-3 main aspects. The Trees, the small bushes and medium bushes. Each planet has a vast difference to the next in their flora with trees coming in 2-3 different types from metallic trees to plain out alien tentacles.Now onto the fauna: Each planet has 3 or more ground based animals which increase in strength further beneath the planets surface. Starbound has a feature where animals are customized via their limbs and body. There are many arms, legs, feet and bodies all just jumbled to together from monster to monster making cute monsters and just plain out terrifying ones. There are also around 2 bird species per planet. Using the same general system.I personally suggest this game because of its deep and fluid experience and its wide modding community.8-9/10 for an early access and its only going to get better!\"}]},\n",

I have no idea what others are complaining about.Anyways.In my opinion i like it even slightly better than Gta 5 which i own.it has such a good story and ypu can dictate the story on several occasions like choosing to kill or not kill somebody which affects you later on positively or negativly or choosing weather to accept an offer or not.The combat is imersive. as you harm an enemy their preformance goes down and you cand shoot them a mlion times in the hand to kill them. This is still up for a little improvementsMods can be very fun and after finishing the story i reccomend installing one after finnishing the story.However you should install an ENB asap because it greatly enhances the graphics.'},\n",

       "    'review': \"This game has an excellent style of fighting with high amounts of diferent weapons to use from. With the help of the hl2 engine, the graphics, models of weapons and characters, this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time. As well as this, map-making is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it, same with plugins for custom servers, Source Film Maker and many more things. This is overall a stunning game that I have played for a while and deserves a yes. GG Valve.Some things that may put it down, however, would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style. For example, the Gun Mettle update brought in contracts, new maps, etc. The halloween update brought in the same thing, but just different missions.People who play other shooter games, that are like COD, Battlefield, etc. One thing i would have to say to those people would be, don't shout at the medic to run to you and specifically YOU because apparantely YOU are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha, family business and your eviction notice. Pub doesnt work like that, sunshine.As well as this, don't be an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to the new kid or some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• just because you got screwed over when you were new. At some point this new kid will have a better inventory, (yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player) better items, and a better fighting style. TF2 doesnt need those kinds of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on their servers.Either way, although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy, there will be better things introduced. Frankly, i want some new weapons, they've been just introducing reskins. Example, Batsaber.Yes.\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"Once all the twelvies aren't playing, and you're up against people who know what they're doing, it's a great game. When all slots are filled it's highly balanced. It's controls are responsive and nothing beats sniping a shark while hanging upside down in the corner with a harpoon.The only problem is the AI. In a game where majority of the gameplay is based off line of sight, and moving without being seen, an AI really destroys it. They can always see you, and never miss as a shark or a diver. They ruin any game almost instantly, but besides that, it's worth buying it when it's on sale.Not entirely sure if it's worth paying full price however, as that's around $80 for you and 3 other friends. And it isn't completely worth paying full price for it.\"},\n",

This game is genuinely a masterpiece and i have never played a game that made me feel so many emotions that range all over the spectrum, i mean hell I thought The Last of Us was emotional as hell. one minute its happy then desparation then wanting to cry like a baby (points in the game specifically made me question my manhood due to how much i was trying to not break down like a baby) this game honestly does show alot of great points that are true in real life as well, like value those close to you and despite this being the internet and it not being known to be shown but, showing compassion and taking the time to give a helping hand could possibly save someones life. It is funny that a troll on tf2 would find such a great love and change of perspective from a game, call me names call me what ever the hell you like. I never thought i would go deep about a game but simply put this game, while it may not be for everyone, is a really great game and i honestly say it is worth more that just 20 dollars. 100/10'},\n",

I never could have imagined this garbage is what you\\'d spew up from the depths of whatever \\'creative\\' hell it came from. I thought you would learn from what Obsidian did with New Vegas, more depth - more REALISM.The map is smaller than Skyrim, Todd. Not in length, or width, but in the sense that the little things are missing. The special touch and charm that is just on the cusp of every corner you\\'d turn in the previous fallout titles is missing... The environment feels hollow, too vibrant, too smooth. It\\'s not the same Fallout theme I grew to crave and felt wonder at. You traded something original, something special, from those wonky shooter mechanics to the skill bar and karma system, for what? better FPS mechanics and a more \\'console-friendly\\' interaction system? I would suggest that all digital copies are wiped and the physical copies piled into a garbage dump like Atari did when E.T. the Extra Terrestrial failed... but I digress...This game should serve as a warning to those who find themselves with an IP as significant as the Fallout Universe. It\\'s like they say - \"IF IT AIN\\'T BROKE, DON\\'T FIX IT!\" Do yourself a favour and buy Fallout: New Vegas, instead of this $80 squirming feeling of regret and hopelessness.'},\n",

Besides that, this game doesn't feel the same as it did 5 years ago. In my personal opinion the new content  scheme they've borrowed from one of their other games, CS:GO, shows a stark indication of how much damage the newer updates have wreaked on the TF2 community. The new guns/skins look awful, it's a transplant from CS gone wrong. It's a lot more toxic, and competitive in TF2 now, F2P destroyed the quality of an already degrading player base. Idle and achievement servers fill up the server list completely. TF2, we had a good run... but now it's time for this grizzled mercenary to hang up his hats.\"}]},\n",

The TF2 community might be at the lowest yet with the new Tough Break update but still even if the biggest people in TF2 such as Jerma985 and Star_ are sick of it I am not it just shows how much this game has dragged me back to it even if I rejected to,eventually I would return and play because I know I want to most my friends that I played TF2 with I barely even see play it but I don't care this game is one of the most special games I've ever played and it was one of the very first games that I've actually stuck around on others I got bored of after getting sick and tired of their repetitive style but still for some reason this game is the only one where I won't stop even if I want to.I'll get to the point of it now I absolutely LOVE and I mean LOVE this game no matter what people tell me about how it isn't as competetive as CS:GO or it is stupid because of how they're always hats on people's heads this game is different from your normal FPS games you actually have to work as a team well to win the game not just run around and shoot people its classes are all balanced and don't handle like COD,Battlefield or CS:GO which shows how different it is so why not give it a try if I and many can enjoy it shows no reason why you can't go download TF2 now and I mean NOW Mr.\"},\n",

This game is a RPG styled game, kinda like Mario and Luigi back in time, you can pick a class to choose between: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew. For me personally i liked the Fighter the best, his skills were my favourites. This game is worth the money, although it is short if you rush it (Which i didn't) this game will be worth you're time. Have fun!\"},\n",

PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONEOverall 10/10 on the Wolf ScaleIt is rather sweet and careful constructed story and this game really deserves alot of praise.I will be playing this game again..

The Controls feel too heavy and he drops like a stone when u jump..nothing like how it used to be3. the stages are just.. It doesnt bring any charm back to what the stages were in sonic 1..4. the controls are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•5. I wasted money on this..Overall..This game is a 2/10.. please dont buy it..Instead.. go buy sonic 1-3 for the sega megadrive on steam...SOOO MUCH BETTER\"},\n",

Visually this game is beautiful, and exploring Rapture again was encredibly enjoyable. Being an actual Big Daddy makes you feel more badass, unlike in the first game,  which just makes you feel like a person with a Big Daddy Suit  This is a very underrated game that has a dense storyline, beautiful setting and a new way of approaching combat.I recommend this game with the whole of my heart and everyone who buys this game will enjoy it.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'So after 30 odd hours i thought i\\'d write a reasonable review because my thoughts on this game have changed alot. So at first i wasnt so keen on ubisoft relaseasing another game so shortly after Unity, which i think i speak for everyone, despite an attempt at a next-gen engine, it was still average at best. Rogue to me feels like im playing the best bit of the AC franchise, The ship from AC4 and the same unchanged New York map from AC3 to name a few. Some elements from previous multiplayer have also been added in, despite there being an actual multiplayer. My main attractions to Rogue would be the tie-ins to other parts of the franchise, the expansion on the Kenway saga from Black Flag, the Birth of Achillies and his part in AC4 (seems like a sequel, Fast and Furious flash back anyone, *cough* Han *cough*). This also raises another issue i have however, these connections seem very much like Ubisoft are tying loose end to the AC4 and AC3 series, which we saw happen in revelations. Obviosuly this game is far better than Revelations, but is it? im not saying rogue is a cash cow but if the same thing is happening again and ubisoft are working on something in the background, Rogue is nothing more than a slight o\\' hand (see the pirate reference?), a very visually appealing one at that, they went pretty hard out with this one, even if it is just tying up loose ends and mamking the whole Benjamin Franklin and Achilies issues seem more realistic, it was worth it. Touching on that further, despite being released after PS3/4 and XB360/1, Rogue also had a lower realease cost, which also leads me to believe there is more in store for his franchise, this is in no way the end, ubisoft opened a can of worms by releasing the Templar play with Shay and i personally think it will breathe new light into a somewhat dying franchise.Some things i disagree with:- Bring back the crouch, creates a better sense of realism, i literally walked passed enemies and no one even battered an eye lid. (not legit)- Bring back multiplayer, even if it was only the sailing, i would play that for hours. Seriously, that would have made this game epic. - Hunting is no fun, i dont know anyone who enjoys the hunting challenges.Give this one a go, if you liked the ship from AC4 and Black Flag then its even better here Rogue, Also there is less \"land play\" which made me happy.Have to congratulate Ubisoft here, well rounded game, stable enough for a PC version of AC, playable and enjoyable. P.s Dont take the ship away again.Cheers,Lordelicious.'},\n",

It presents a very basic challenge, to get through the map, however it take something so siple with one movement, jumping, and makes you feel like your hands are painted on and before you know it you're in the feotal position wondering where the hours went. Truly recommend this game.\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"Great game, you can tell just by the number of people reviewing this game negatively with over 100h (or 400h) played.Sure there are a few bugs, but the devs are working hard on fixing stuff, communicate with the community and release patches with a lot of new content every other month.This is a game based on grinding, and sometime it will take time to get your gears just the way you want it. But the DZ is a great experience, with some balancing issues that will shift the meta of the game strongly towards a build here and there.Haven't seen a hacker in 2 months (playing the DZ fairly often, rank > 82). People saying the game is full of hackers are the same guys that get rekt in CS and call hacks on everyone.  I strongly recommend this game for both the PvE and the PvP aspect.\"},\n",

Its like minecraft and dayz combined, with the voxly box world this game utilizes, its like a more mature version of minecraft, without the high stakes and risk of losing your gear, unlike dayZ, 7days to die is more forgiving. Playing this game by yourself is good to see what you can build in the time but its even more fun to play with friends. Don't mistake this as minecraft though, i Find it brings a more personal touch to a survival game.\"},\n",

As an Australian, I rarely, if ever, get a stable connection to Europe. i.e, I can't play the game at all. I can't even launch it.EDIT: I managed to get into the game. It looks okay, loading time is a little long for what the game looks like. But that's okay. I managed to get into a match, even with enough people in the queue I think they were all AI's, they had first/last names. Maybe the playerbase is just weird. The big problem was aforementioned connection issues. I couldn't do anything, Moving was constant rubber banding between where I started and where I was trying to move to.Don't get me wrong, it looks like a decent game. I'd play this. But I can't recommend it with such atrocious servers, and not even having servers for everyone else. If there were North American servers, i'd recommend this game.\"},\n",

I will find you if you don't.^ Kek, what an old report.Personally I think you shouldn't play this game, although it might get better in a few years.I bought this game as soon as it came out, I bought the founders two pack. It was fun, pretty buggy, but it was full of promise. Skip forward a few years later. The game is worse. Lets talk about starting the game. The game is slow to start. Starting a game will take just as long, and when you get into the game itself, prepare for unoptimized slowness. The game runs terribly, is riddled with bugs and the devs generally don't add any new content. If this was developed by a good indie team, or an AAA team (Oh, did i forgot to mention they fired several people who worked at Bioware, and hired some scrubs?), it would be amazing. The concept is great, I would have really looked forward to this game shining, but the devs are horrible. I do not recommend this game.\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'ADVERTENCIA:Este An√°lisis contiene posibles Spoilers. ¬°Lee bajo tu propio riesgo!Historia...En esta historia, encarnamos a un cient√≠fico llamado Gordon Freeman, su trabajo parece ser sencillo‚Ä¶ ponerse un traje de protecci√≥n \"H.E.V\" e ir a la c√°mara de pruebas. Es all√≠ donde se encuentra el Cristal ‚ÄúGG-3883‚Äù, un mineral del planeta Xen que fue capturado para una investigaci√≥n. Cuando todo marchaba ‚Äúnormalmente‚Äù ocurre una peque√±a tormenta de portales dentro de la c√°mara de pruebas seguido de una gran explosi√≥n que afecta a todo el sector. Freeman, despu√©s de despertar, no solo se encuentra con cient√≠ficos heridos y/o muertos, sino tambi√©n con la fauna de Xen que viajaron atreves de una brecha dimensional. Al ver la situaci√≥n de emergencia en la que se encontraba no solo el sector, sino tambi√©n todo Black Mesa, inmediatamente sube a la superficie abri√©ndose paso entre los Xenianos pero al llegar se encuentra con las fuerzas especiales H.E.C.U. que est√°n ‚Äúsilenciando‚Äù a todo el personal de Black Mesa y eliminar todas las pruebas del desastre. Al ver la situaci√≥n, Freeman se mueve a trav√©s de todo Black Mesa para llegar al Complejo LŒªmbda y cerrar la brecha dimensional antes de que se extienda por todo el mundo‚Ä¶Jugabilidad...HŒªlf-Life es una verdadera obra maestra cuando nos referimos a √©l como un juego ‚ÄúSingle Player‚Äù, el objetivo del juego es utilizar pensamientos l√≥gicos y nuestro armamento para sobrevivir en un entorno lleno de enemigos con distintas habilidades, tambi√©n hay situaciones en el que los puzzles (al menos en los primeros d√≠as) pueden llegar a ser un problema.Variedad...El arsenal del juego que es muy variado desde armas simples como la Crowbar, Clock 17, Mp5 y Spas 12, hasta armas potentes, tanto militares, experimentales y alien√≠genas. No es lo √∫nico en variaci√≥n, tambi√©n hay una gran cantidad de enemigos como los soldados H.E.C.U., las asesinas Blacks Ops, alien√≠genas de distintos tama√±os y poderes e incluso los guardias de seguridad si llegas a causarle heridas intencionalmente. Y la m√∫sica no se queda atr√°s, cada escenario tiene su propio ambiente musical que puede generar tensi√≥n o adrenalina en el jugador.Innovaci√≥n...La interacci√≥n con los NPC, el modelado y sus animaciones, para su √©poca, eran sorprendentes, a pesar de que en ciertos momentos pueden sufrir de glitches. Los gr√°ficos de ese momento, los efectos de luces y sombras, dise√±os del entorno y la ambientaci√≥n, Hacen que el jugador realmente sienta que est√° dentro del juego, esto es gracias a su motor GoldSrc, una versi√≥n modificada del motor Quake.Multijugador...El multijugador de HŒªlf-Life tampoco ha quedado de lado, su gran variaci√≥n de armas, los orificios de bala en las paredes, salpicaduras de sangre o mejor, despedazar los cuerpos de los jugadores, la posibilidad de crear servers dedicados, la gran variedad de mapas incluyendo los oficiales y los que fueron creados por la comunidad, los personajes para controlar aunque en este aspecto hay pocos, aun as√≠ el jugador puede agregar m√°s personajes al multijugador aunque los dem√°s jugadores no tendr√°n la posibilidad de verlo.Mods...Como √∫ltimo punto, el motor GoldSrc, es un motor f√°cilmente manipulable, tanto que se han creado  varios mods del juego, como los m√°s conocidos como Counter-Strike y Team Fortress, hasta los m√°s olvidados como Deathmatch Classic y Ricochet, aunque estos son mods oficiales, la comunidad ha creado gran variedades de mods como USS Darkstar, Azure Sheep y Sven Coop.Puntos Negativos...Los √∫nicos puntos malos del juego son que en el viaje del inicio es muy largo, aunque esto se puede omitir con la consola, la poca variedad que hay con los aliados, que son solo un cient√≠fico con cuatro modelos de personajes y un guardia de seguridad, las armas y enemigos de la versi√≥n Œ≤eta que no aparecieron ni siquiera en el multijugador, y el no incluir la campa√±a especial ‚ÄúDecay‚Äù, un modo de juego exclusivo de Play Station 2 que permite jugar con 2 cient√≠ficas.GAMEPLAY:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0SOUND:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0HISTORY:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0INNOVATION:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖDIFFICULTY:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0GRAPHICS:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0DURATION:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0TOTAL:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ú©‚ú©\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/70'},\n",

       "    'review': \"I'd definitely recommend this game for people who want to expand their vocabulary, but there are a few things I'd like to point out.-While this is almost never required for romance languages, in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, words, Especially adjectives and verbs, can be synonymous but imply different things. This is almost always the case in Japanese, where verbs have transitive and intransitive forms, but this is not listed in the definition, only one form is presented. This means doing research on the word you'll find yourself using more will help you be more fluent in the long run.-So much katakana... I'd like to see really rare kanji forms of words, as they can appear in stories and some videogames (You know, like English games using the words, 'Thee', 'Thou', etc. They're rare because of their age, but they can still find a use in medieval style games!). In fact, I might prefer it that way as I want to learn as much words as possible and converting English to katakana is easy when you learn about how Japanese pronunciation works. Just add a note to say it's rare to avoid confusion.-Some objects are... Odd. I saw this red box and the definition said it was a piggy bank or something, I was confused until I saw a dial, which meant it was a safe. Maybe you should make objects cliched/stereotyped and exaggerated to help people understand with a quick glance.-It doesn't follow spaced repitition, so you can mash the replay button endlessly until you get yourself a star. If you're a serious learner, never press the replay button, as you just bring it back to your short term memory and fail to remember it the next few days, at least space the replays by an hour the *first* time you try it.-Lists make it too easy sometimes, avoid using them and just use the random button, as I found myself just clicking whatever's next to the last object I clicked on, as I was able to remember the next thing I added right after. This is a mnemonic that relies on the location of the object INGAME, so it doesn't really help you learn. If you really want to do lists, run around the whole house clicking random items and adding them to the list, avoiding any sort of order or pattern.And here's some tips for Japanese:-Avoid Romaji, in fact, do kanji, when you don't know a word, you don't know it, there's no improving your ability to decipher meaning from kanji, so just dive right into it. Do kana if you're really keen on learning pronunciation before reading, and want to do it really, really quickly. Same thing probably applies with Pinyin and Hanzi, but I haven't played  the Chinese version so I don't know if Pinyin is provided.-The dots that appear between kana when you look at how to read the kanji is important, memorise the kana in sections divided by the dots, and their associated kanji (e.g. (ÊØéÊó• [„Åæ„ÅÑÔºä„Å´„Å°] „Åæ„ÅÑ is ÊØé and „Å´„Å° is Êó•)) This is important, words might have multiple readings, and you might get them wrong, but if you memorise at least ONE reading for the kanji, you can type it on a computer, and even get the correct reading by typing the kanji on a dictionary.-While katakana is easy when you know it well enough, sometimes it isn't, as you might say different versions of a word (E.g. Fairy Floss vs. Cotton Candy, (Well, it's neither when translated to Japanese, but you get my point!)) or it's just katakana but isn't based on English, (e.g. „Éë„É≥ for bread). Either way, it's nice to learn a ton of katakana in this game as you get badges for it.Other than that, it's good as you'll find objects in an every day home, and the exploration stops you from being bored quickly, and most importantly:It makes you think of (and therefore associate the word you're learning with) objects and pictures, rather than the English translation, which means that you can achieve fluency which allows you to form sentences in the language you want in your head directly, rather than creating an English sentence, translating it to your wanted language, THEN saying, writing or expressing it.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Best game ever, very little P2W, as all payable items actually can be detrimental to your playing skills, an expert who started with bad equipment will have more potential than a new player who uses very high level equipment, as he\\'ll be used to it and fail really badly when there\\'s an event that measures skill only and gives people similar equipment. Also, all high level equipment are sorted by level, so if you can\\'t buy it with ingame currency, it means specialising isn\\'t a very good idea until you get to a higher level. Payable items don\\'t have this restriction, so very powerful equipment can be put in the hands of new players. Keep in mind that all equipment has a bonus, but an equal penalty, making it not \"powerful\" in a linear sense, but if you specialise in a way that suits your playstyle, it makes you more powerful (but doing this early can bar you from changing your strategy and trying new techniques.)In terms of gameplay, everyone is -mostly- equal, some more general and some more specialized, it depends mostly on skill. Some elements are more powerful than others, not statistically, but in usage and opportunities to cast with most effect.'},\n",

Yes the game is free great, but all they want is your money, the second you ask for a refund due to a real reason, they will bite you in the butt and throw you under the bus.Share this so people are aware, free to play really is not all that great, and warframe have shown that.Due to legal rights at this point in time, i'm unable to show the conversations i've had between paypal and the warframes support until the case is completed.\"}]},\n",

You get a wide selection of people because it randomizes it.  One bad thing the hacking is kinda linear its only things that are ran by computers and it limits you on that you cant go and hack a building to turn their lights off (execpt for blackout but my point is you can turn ONE building off).  The multiplayer is not the best but It is not that bad. sure its confusing on how to join multiplayer for your first time but you figure out sometime.  Note, Get the DLC because it helps the story A LOT.  So my rating for this game would have to be a...  7/10 Not entirly bad but It does have its down points.'}]},\n",

Plus you can take fall damage from sliding down slops so watch out- Loot Crates do spawn all around the map, and there's certain areas where good loot spawns.Loot mostly contains:WeaponsClothesAmmoHealthFinal:As i said the game is still in early access so not everything is in the game, but it still is a great game to playJust don't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off a T-Rex, okay? Final-Final:So is this  a good game to buy and play: YESIt is worth the $20 you stole\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"+: Combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way.+: One of the only if any MMO's that allows you to dig on the terrarian itself (although you can't build on the terrain unless it's in your own 'cornerstone' which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at).+: For an MMO this game took an interesting style of graphics that I haven't seen done before (in an MMO).+: A bunch of classes to chose from, all seeming quite different from one another.+: The game is free.+: Can be a good MMO for someone who's never played one.+: You can 'deassemble' a weapon or accessory you don't want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more useful.(Stating this) Many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed (to my understanding).-: Although there is a huge arsenal of weapons (that you are pre-assigned based on your class e.g. Shadow Archers will ONLY receive bows) none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety.-: You progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats. The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"INTRODUCTION/STORYTitan Souls takes the approach Dark Souls has with its story. It gives you little to no information and rather instead leaves you to sort of generate your own theories about it. This isn't a bad thing at all especially for people like me with ADHD. We easily get lost trying to keep up with stories and often forget important details. If you're looking for a story rich game  stop reading now and go look for something else  because you will be very disappointed. You will need some sort of controller if you wish to stand a chance in Titan Souls. The keyboard controls are pretty bad. GENERAL OVERVIEWTitan Souls is extremely simplistic and follows a pattern that you'll most likely come to love. Every boss is a 1-2 shot kill and you (the player) are also a one shot kill. Unlike many games where you the player may feel you have a huge advantage over the boss or vice versa I feel there's something special about Titan Souls. It may be weird to say but in Titan Souls I always felt I was on an even playing field since there is no progression (you never get any upgrades, throughout the entire game you have the same weapons, stats, etc) I actually came to love this. No BS, Titan Souls is all about skipping the grinding and getting straight to the chase; the bosses. COMBATCombat in TS takes a very interesting approach. You get one arrow which can be brought back to you by holding down the same button you used to fire the arrow. Your arrow will travel distance based on how long you charge it. This gives every shot meaning since whatever you fire you must either chase after or pull back towards you. The con of pulling is it you must stand still, this sounds like a very small thing but in TS this can make some very tricky situations during fights. Most fights come down to a matter of how well you can aim in fast paced situations.PRICE AND PLAY TIMEThe base game took me about three hours to complete. Upon beating the game you unlock a few other modes which can extend your play time but it's still the same game. I purchased this game during the Steam 2016 Summer Sale for about $3.75 and I can say it was definitely worth the price. I would definitely not puchase this game at full price though, I personally think AT MOST this game should be sold for around $10. I highly recommend you download the demo for this game as it gives you a few of the bosses from the game to see how you'll like it. This is the reason I bought TS and I can say the demo was in fact a pretty accurate representation of what the game itself is like.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"If I had to describe Shmadow in a few words I'd have to say it's as if bullet hells, endless runners, and sidescrollers had a child. There isn't very much to say about this game but let's talk about it anyway. You're a ball of light who shoots other balls of various colors. Your character and your bullets produce light allowing you to see through the darkness. The more damage you take the less light you produce making it harder to survive. You get get an attack that recharges over a short cooldown and you pickup powerups which can also be used to assist you. You fight bosses and your objective is to make it as far as you can without losing. That's pretty much all there is to say about Shmadow.The GoodOne of the easiest achievement hunts you'll ever see.You can play through the entire game and refund it if you don't enjoy it due to the game being so short.You don't need a controller to do well (I got every achievement using keyboard and mouse).Due to trading cards existing you'll make a large portion of what you spent on the game (if you bought it on sale) back from selling them.Very short soundtrack although it's a very fitting song that doesn't get annoying.Regardless of how much playtime you get it's still only 2 USD.Several difficulties/modes.Really cool bosses.The BadSuper short playtime (15 ish minutes if you're playing normally and 30-90 minutes if you're achievement hunting depending on how good you are at Shmadow). One playthrough of the game is enough for a player to see every boss along with the majority of the content.I like the graphics although I cannot deny that there was very little effort put into them.There's no tutorial although there's a controls section on the main menu.You have to use the powerup to know what it does (they have no titles, just icons) and for a game this short I doubt you want to memorize all of them.If you're poor (and I mean very poor) this game isn't a good choice for you considering the lack of playtime you'll get out of it. If you aren't poor you've got nothing to lose no matter how much playtime you get out of it.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Basically SR3 2.0.I‚Äôve completed the main story of SR3 three times, I have every achievement and I‚Äôve put in about 160 hours (PS3). That being said I‚Äôm having a blast on SR4 even though it uses a replica of Steelport (with some changes such as alien tech).Many people say the super powers ruin the game, this is totally up to you to decide. I love the super powers.. but here‚Äôs a few things to note.-\\tBy completing side quests I‚Äôve already unlocked unlimited super sprint stamina and I‚Äôm only on what.. the sixth mission? This should be unlocked towards the end of the game.-\\tI have three of the eight super powers. I can fly/glide/super jump (all one power), super sprint, and shoot freeze blasts. I‚Äôm telling you this just so you have an idea of what to expect.-\\tYou‚Äôll probably never rely on vehicles for transportation after a few upgrades on your super sprint, I like this but at the same time I dislike this.I‚Äôve seen many of the old characters make an appearance so far, it brought me some warm memories.Anyways.. so far I‚Äôm really enjoying this game. I can‚Äôt say you‚Äôll enjoy SR4 as much as the previous games but if you end up enjoying the super powers you‚Äôll have a lot of fun with this game. I got this for 5$ so I‚Äôd say this was well worth the money I spent.'},\n",

       "    'review': \"Written VersionA Story About My Uncle is a game that presented itself to me as quite promising with its amazing atmosphere which sucked me in from the beginning. I was later led to disappointment as I realized just how little story there actually is and that the game relies on using cliffhangers to keep the player going. I was fine with this until I completed the game and was left quite unsatisfied. The game made me very eager to see just what would happen next as I swung from stage to stage hoping that I'd get some dialogue. The ending left me quite disappointed as I saw the developer could've done much more with the game. A lot of players have trouble with this game (refer to the other reviews for this, mostly the negative). I find that this is what gives players their play time. The developer is asking $13 for a game that could take a player 1-3 hours to complete (depending on just how much they die).-----------------------------------------------------Pro/Con VersionPros- What little dialogue there is can drive your curiosuity enough to keep you playing.- Amazing atmosphere.- Fun gameplay.Cons- Very little dialogue.- 1-3 hours of gameplay.- Monotone narrator/unconvincing voice actors (don't let the narrator's beautiful voice fool you!)- Massive price tag for how long the game is.-----------------------------------------------------Conclusion: I'd say get it on sale, it's a very fun game however its price tag is just quite demanding. For a story based game the story really isn't there; the atmosphere is. You could get something that'll get you more for your buck elsewhere.\"}]},\n",

They may be coming soon but at the moment, I go on it regularly just to see if its had an update for AUS servers. I would still recommend picking it up if its on sale (Atleast 25%) and play with friends on a local hosted server.I give it a thumbs up, but if you're in Australia, don't bother unless you are a singeplayer person, stand high ping or if its atleast 50% off.~Hope this helped\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"Square's Route is a game in which you control a cube within a mostly isometric world.The aim is to navigate throughout each level so that you squish the specified plants. To squish them, you must move over them with the plant's corresponding colour face down on the cube, however every time you move the cube, it will roll, causing the positions of the colours to change. While this may sound simple, it can get very difficult to work out.Square's Route is very well designed, introducing one new feature and challenge at a time, with level design that ensures you understand what is being introduced before you proceed. I never felt too overwhelmed, but it mixed up the gameplay and kept it interesting.Square's route is incredibly cute and full of charm. You should enjoy this game if you enjoy puzzles, planning ahead, and spatial reasoning.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"Think of minesweeper crossed with sudoku.Hexcells Infinite is basically that with a few extra gimmicks added in.When playing, I feel like I'm using sudoku logic, but in a binary way, where each square will be either blue or black.Despite the simplicity of how it looks, this is actually a fairly challenging game.Apparantly you never have to guess on any level, even if it is a procedurally generated one, but sometimes, I'll be looking at the puzzle for a while, oblivious to what I'm supposed to do next.This is a fun game if you enjoy thinking things through logically and enjoy puzzles such as sudoku. I personally enjoy this more than sudoku.As a bonus, completing a level will create a pattern, which is interesting to look at sometimes.\"},\n",

It does not feel like it is forced in at all.You might be worried about replayability, but with the addition of the level creator, the community can now create and share their own levels very easily.

       "    'review': 'This game is essentially a maze where things are not as they seem and where it changes with seemingly no reason.As you play more, you will likely start to understand what makes the maze change. You will also acquire \"guns\" which allow you to manipulate some blocks in the maze to aid you.Guns will get better the more you find and allow you to access new areas if you can understand how to use and manipulate it\\'s effects.Simplistic level design and no storyline. Any storyline will be mostly made up by the player.Very little replayability, but there are many different paths and solutions for puzzles leading to those paths that give you a few things to go back and complete.I\\'d recommend this game if you like mazes and thinking in a way that contradicts logic.This will be a very confusing game for you if you are not prepared.'},\n",

It aint nuthin but a game thatz part of tha oldschool breed dat has survived tha decade n' has mostly retained its visceral, gunfighter esque, snappy gameplay wit a underlyin competitve element dat forces tha playa ta outthink hos opponent first n' outreact themt ta a lesser degree. Everyone be a crewplayer, n' if you not, tha magic of dis game is dat it forces you to, fo' a lack of mo' betta lyrics, git phat at it, n' cuz of dat it propels tha user ta try n' stand toe ta toe wit veterans n' freshly smoked up blood alike on a almost punishingly level ground. Y'all KNOW dat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a! Counter Strike Source is by far da most thugged-out ghettofab varaint of tha Counter Strike series, fo' tha phat reason dat past tha core elementz of tha game from rescuin hostages ta defusin (or planting) bombs, there be a much mo' user pimped content dat dis game owes its engine like a mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a. This game be a must have, cuz if not fo' tha forever relevent competitizzle scene, itz fo' tha bhop maps, zombie escapes, jail breaks, mini games, n' fo' tha mobilitizzle ta git a game wit hthe Source Engine SDK.It aint nuthin but not a game dat has aethestically kept wit time yo, but its forumla has, n' I bet dat it will outlive even tha juggernautz of tha younger Call of Duty n' Battlefield titles. This be a game of not reqardin tha playa wit trinkets like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in freshly smoked up glocks or freshly smoked up faces ta wear yo, but of self satisfaction of whoopin up a entire enemy crew up in a cold-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• lil clutch move n' brangin down tha hurt wit a well gots AWP. That runs deep, n' dis game aint NEVER gonna make you forget dat tha only thang seperatin you from acin wit a Deagle n' viewin yo' crew fro ma spectators seat is yo' own skill.

       "    'review': \"To commemorate tha beta of Steam Reviews, it only make sense dat I finally write a recommendation fo' a game dat has been close ta mah ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• since tha dizzle I was first introduced ta it: Terraria.Terraria has proven ta be a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of funk ta play, n' has been one of mah freshest vizzle game time sinks up in recent mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in years cuz of dat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a funky-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• broad permittizzle fo' exploration n' a wide selection of buildin decor, itz tha type of game dat strikes me as havin suttin' fo' everyone. Which is good, when you consider dat it also has multiplayer n' ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Even mo' betta when you git ta tha late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors n' tools ta allow fo' a wide variety of specializations.Buildin n' exploration is phat points up in favor of tha game yo, but tha gameplay mechanics is suttin' I'd like ta single up fo' praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of spectacle, n' like thatz part of why I find it so charmin yo. Hurtin enemies--even dem playas whoz ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is vastly inferior ta you--feels good. Y'all KNOW dat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a! I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg! It aint nuthin but satisfyin ta hear tha hit sound on tha mo' squishy enemies, n' peep dem explode tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• into fine lil chunks when they take a thugged-out dirt nap. Ground movement could be mo' betta yo, but certain late game ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• hit you wit tha mobilitizzle ta dash n' fly, which straight-up expand how tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you can explore n' fight fo' realz. And wit a wide selection of weapons, every last mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in playa is bound ta find a rosta of tools, spells n' fish-related artillery dat fits they playstyle.Da game aint without flaws, mind yo thugged-out ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. With tha gamez update history, tha launch endgame now vastly differs from dat of tha current one. This has hustled ta some balizzle n' progression issues, da most thugged-out glarin of which bein how tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• sluggish tha early game feels. Well shiiiit, it worries me dat tha start of tha game might dissuade some playas from playing, when they might ludd what tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tha late game has ta offer n' ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Da game also has a wack g-thang of recyclin mob AI wit reskins, though dis be averted by adjustin certain parametas n' givin dem unique abilitizzles ta hide tha fact. Even though I have mo' ta say bout tha shortcomings, there be a just too much phat up in tha game ta stay mad bout what tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• effectively boils down ta nitpicking.Plus, it has hats fo' realz. Any game dat has a selection of basebizzle caps gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other props. If dis be lookin like suttin' you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a cold-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• lil chance. Da game occasionally goes on sale fo' 75% off, so pick up a gangbangin' four pack fo' yo ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• n' three playas. If I be wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I be sorry as a mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a bout dat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t. But if I be right, then it'll be well worth tha price. We sposed ta ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in pay $60 these minutes fo' a gangbangin' fulfillin gamin experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.

Right back up in yo mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Strangely, each character has tha mysterious juice ta fire one or two shots without wack recoil by straight-up briefly jerkin up in tha opposite direction they is movin in. I aint talkin\\' bout chicken n\\' gravy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. When yo\\' character wears a Kevlar vest, every last mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in part of yo\\' character, except tha head, is made outta steel. Therefore, tha only way ta quickly bust a cap up in playas is ta blast dem up in tha head. Y\\'all KNOW dat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a! This can be buggin at first yo, but yo big-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• booty is ghon soon git used ta blastin a lil\\' small-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• smudge of pixels on top of a cold-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• lil characterz body. Da Goddess of Guns can materialize glocks up in yo\\' characterz handz all dem secondz before a round starts, n\\' you can put dat on yo\\' toast. But ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat yo\\' character must pay fo\\' tha guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have tha right amount of scrilla, tha Goddess will flash a menu up in yo\\' characterz eyes, allowin dem ta select tha glocks they want. Mo\\' advanced playas can make glocks materialize outta thin air wit they mind as long as they have tha right amount of scrilla.Maps is often bout evil terrorists tryin ta take a thugged-out dump on deserted places. Vandalizzle be a straight-up straight-up crime up in tha Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists is deployed ta stop em. Unfortunately fo\\' tha Terrorists, they is dumb n\\' only packed one bomb. But ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat tha Counter-Terrorists do not know how tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ta pick up a thugged-out dropped bomb, so tha Terrorists can still pick it up afta it is dropped by a gangbangin\\' fallen playa.In some maps, tha terrorists have kidnapped a janitor n\\' low-level desk jockey up in a funky-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• building. Da Counter-Terrorists done been deployed ta save one, not both, of tha hostages. In reality, dis is just a thinly-veiled excuse fo\\' tha CTs ta cappin\\' tha Terrorists while pumpin roundz tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• into tha invincible hostages. One weird thang bout hostage maps is dat you can purchase a \"Hostage Rescue Kit\", which somehow make gives you tha mobilitizzle ta put a grown playa on yo\\' shouldaz up in a second. Y\\'all KNOW dat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a! Perhaps it aint nuthin but a spell scroll dat allows hostages ta hover ta yo\\' characterz shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive be a surprisingly solid game bout playas wit da most thugged-out ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• glock handlin abilitizzles eva peeped on Earth. Even though yo\\' charactas have tha aimin abilitizzlez of one of mah thugs wit Parkinsons Disease, you have nuff tactical options dat make tha game straight-up funk n\\' dynamic.

They may even know Gangsta but just chizzle not ta drop a rhyme it, all tha while trash rappin\\' you up in they own natizzle language.Many times if you rap r crewmates which lane yo ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is takin before tha match starts n\\' select it on tha map they will insist minutes afta tha match has started dat instead you do what tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• THEY want, fo\\' example they want you ta put a low on mana SUPPORT pimp by themself up in tha MIDDLE LANE.If you eva notice yo\\' crewmates ignorin tha chat or bustin thangs together dat may or may not be detrimenstrual ta ballin tha match itz cuz tha majoritizzle of tha time yo big-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• booty is ghon be matched wit playas whoz ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• know eachother up in real game n\\' will only rap wit eachother OUTSIDE of tha game, whether by up in person, or voice communication software, instead of communicatin wit you as well inside tha game, so you gonna git NO IDEA what tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• they is planning.Also, fo\\' tha freshly smoked up playas readin dis review, do not expect ANY help fo\\' ANYTHING, like askin fo\\' lyrics or how tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ta do suttin\\' from tha playas yo ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is playin with, as you WILL be verbally played & reported (which is suttin\\' dat seems ta happen often up in dis game whether yo ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is freshly smoked up or not) instead just fo\\' bein a freshly smoked up playa or any other wack reason, so I suggest bustin ALL tha hustlin missions before you do any real random matchmaking.All dat bein holla\\'d I do recommend (not highly) dis game afta all if yo ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is playin it wit a crew of playaz & you ludd a highly competitizzle Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) aka real-time game (ARTS) game or you simply wanna use its steam market.ORIGINAL REVEIW BY          Am‚ù§          http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099901747'}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"I really enjoyed this game, for the price it is totally worth it. If you can get it on special, even better. Fun storytelling, good combat/perk system and I enjoyed the campaign. Plenty of content after you finish the main storyline with extra difficulty settings, arcade mode and duel mode.I highly recommend this to fans of old school shooters and people who enjoyed Painkiller/Far Cry Blood Dragon. If you are someone who expects every game to revolutionize a genre or be breathtaking, this isn't the game for you as this is more about having fun and not taking the game to seriously.Hope you enjoy\"},\n",

Not the greatest PC port but not the worst i've played either. You really need to be a Metal fan or at least able to listen to that type of music because the whole game is built on music of that genre. It was fun to play a different type of game instead of the usual stuff. At the discounted price you can pick this game up for, you really can't lose. Hope you enjoy it.P.S. The Lore is the best part of the game, make sure you get into the back story as much as possible.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"Great Game.A throw back to old school shooters from the 90's. Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.\"},\n",

As of now I haven't played very long- but I can say I have enjoyed it.On the one hand it most definitely has some P2W elements, but the starting equipment isn't too bad and it doesnt seem like it takes too long to get up there, and this is coming from a person who fundamentally hates P2W games.The early game is pitted against you, enemies have grenades, tanks, automatic weapons, and all you have is a basic semi-auto rifle. Fortunately I discovered most people in heroes and generals aren't very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me, I still manage to score reasonably well sometimes.I have only played as an infantry and am rank 5 or so, so dont take this review too seriously.The vehicles are solid and it's good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point. CRACK CRACK CRACK! (the sounds do need some work though.)Gameplay is kind of clunky but no where near dayz or arma2.I would recommend this game simply because it's free. If they made me pay $10 and removed and the pay2win elements, I would accept in an instant. Hell maybe even $20.\"},\n",

Payday is a first-person bank robbing ,meth cooking, painting stealing simulator and its extremely adictive.  With many different hiest to choose from, bank robbing to cocaine dealing you can aproach each mission in any way you like from equiping the heaviest armor and the strongest gun and going loud to rob a bank to going slow and steady in stealth which does come with a experience bonus. The game is very costumisable from choosing your armor, gun, mask all the way down to your melee. But out of the the costumising you will ever do is your mask whcich defines who you are with over 100 mask to choose from and over 100 different colours and patterns no one ever has the same mask.But all up its a very enjoyable game stealth, loud, with or without friends it dosen't matter the circumstances its a great game for those who enjoy co-op strategic shooter i recomend it to all for only 30 dollars its a great pick up. Yes i know i only have 6 hours on the game when i wrote this review but when the game first came out i played the hell out of it in XBOX 360\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Although the long awaited update finally came out and many things from my original review have been fixed/improved, I still can\\'t give this game a thumbs up- Many new SFX have been added and the in game atmosphere (while playing with music off because I don‚Äôt really like HM music) has improved dramatically, but the title screen is still quiet. The rain is falling, the lightning is flashing, but it‚Äôs all silent. Also, some already existing (but horrible) SFX has been completely dropped out instead of being replaced with better ones. Monsters and skeletons on the first level make no sound at all while walking. You can hear your footsteps but monsters walk silently which looks/\"sounds\" really odd.- Keyboard controls are finally fixed, but now the gamepad is not working. Since the keys can‚Äôt be reassigned, and the default layout is terrible, the game is (at least for me) unplayable. No gamepad also means sitting in front of my monitor instead on my couch and playing on big screen TV.When at least the gamepad support is fixed I‚Äôll gladly change my review to positive. The game progressed a lot since the original release and is finally (almost) how it should have been from the start. ----Original review:This review is based on the latest version of the game available to me, which is v1.0 for OSX (and I believe it‚Äôs also the latest version for Linux). Since the release the developers released a number of patches, Windows only. For a Windows review read somewhere else. I‚Äôll update this as / if game gets updated.From the developers website: \"Slain! is affectionately inspired by games such as Ghosts and Goblins, Altered Beast, Shadow Of The Beast and Golden Axe\"Played all of those as a kid. The only thing that\\'s better in Slain! are graphics. Everything else is much, much worse. So sad I backed this on Kickstarter, can\\'t get the refund. If there was only a bug here or there, I would have hope that it can be fixed. But it\\'s not about the bugs here (actually haven\\'t encountered any), it\\'s about poor game design, really bad controls, missing sound effects‚Ä¶ In the games mentioned above there was at least some feedback / knock back when you get hit by an enemy, in Slain! enemies walk through you. Sure, all this can be fixed but it‚Äôs not a question of days but rather months. At this stage, I would suggest to the developers to slap the ‚Äúearly access‚Äù badge on this and take it from there.EDIT #4:As of 31 May developers \"hope\" they\\'ll have OSX (that probably means Linux too) update ‚Äùin the near future\". Thanks for the kick in the balls, again. EDIT #3:Hoooraaay! Patch 1 is out! It fixes sooo many things! Oh, wait... it\\'s just for Win. No patch for OSX and Linux. But the store page says the game supports OSX and Linux? Well, it also says there are trading cards and achievements.... but you know, who cares anymore.EDIT #2:Achievements are broken. You can get the first one, but that\\'s it, the rest of them don\\'t work. Store page states \"trading cards\", but they are nonexistent.EDIT #1:Try turning the music off and you‚Äôll find that this game is almost mute!Except from generic footsteps and sword sounds there are no sounds when you pick up power ups, die from spikes, break stones or fall down. On the menu screen you see the rain falling and flashes on the screen (lightning) but can‚Äôt hear any of that, it‚Äôs all quiet. At the beginning a monster spawns from the ground, blood sprays from the pit, visually very dramatic‚Ä¶ no sound‚Ä¶ no ground rumbling, no sound of blood spraying, the monster is mute. Fire gargoyles spit fireballs from their mouths‚Ä¶ no sound at all.  Monsters make engine revving like sound which starts quietly, then gradually goes louder, then ends abruptly and then starts over in a loop. Skeletons make a fireplace crackling like sound (bones?) but die without making any sound‚Ä¶ The list goes on and on. And I‚Äôll remind you all that one of the Kickstarter stretch goals (which WAS reached) was hiring ‚Äúdedicated professional audio designer‚Äù.'},\n",

The game is still in early access and will probably stay like that until the real apocalypse happens.\"},\n",

You really want to engage with Henry as he did certain things that I\\'m not going to spoil.The art style of the game is amazing. The orange sunset really pop\\'s out and make everything this amazing orange colour (they make good wallpapers).Now, it terms of gameplay, there isn\\'t much. You just walk around the map doing things and walking back to yout tower. That is the only thing I didn\\'t like about Firewatch, Otherwise it is a great game that you should play.9/10.'}]},\n",

When you have your back to the wall, facing down a Fleshpound and a Scrake, with nothing left but a knife and dead teammates, it really makes your adrenaline kick in. The fact that this game is generally focussed on (but not limited to) multiplayer and teamwork is what makes it that much more enjoyable. Why face hordes of endless flesh-eating creatures alone, when you can share the fun of burning them, blowing them up and hacking them apart with a team? The wide variety of weapons, maps and enemies  really adds to the enjoyment that I got (and continue to get) out of this game.\"}]},\n",

Rockets are good as short burst damage output, but they can be easily dodged and the player usually switches weapons after. Theres hardly any time for sniping, easpecially in relatively small maps,Other than that, the weapon customisation is great and its fun to try out combos. Really gets your heart pumping and the taunts look amazing. 8/10'}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Fantastic game and the story looks promising, I really enjoyed the first parts of the game. Art is nice and the music really fits the scenery. The only problem I have with the game at the current moment is that the where the text is shown to tell us what the characters is saying is a bit big and one of the pictures shows what I believe is a Ball-Point Pen during the time when the Prine and the Merchant are having a chat after they go downstairs in the Inn. Judging from the current art, this would seem something of medieval time. Apart from that I am looking foward to everything you have to throw at me. =^.^='}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"When i started playing STO (Star Trek Online) I was brand new to the universe, i had maybe only watched the newest movie, other than that i knew nothing.Since then I have watched every single episode released to air and all of the movies, no game has ever gotten me so engrossed with the lore before, that itself is a testament to the great albeit cheasy writing that the game has.Now to the game itself...It is a very easy to run game and still looks presentable even on minimal settings, the gameplay is a little confusing at first however there are tutorials both in and out of the game that are of great assistance. The story itself follows a character that you create that is a member of one of the three main factions (Federation, Kilingon Empire and Romulan Republic) this gives you access to a large number of humanoid races and the abilty to an extent create your own race. The missions themselves are refreshing and divided into multiple story arcs to make it easier to find a specific mission you may want to repeat.Combat is done in a great way, both space and ground combat is simple yet fun, all three playable classes (Tactical, Engineer, Science) all have defined roles that are easy to understand and easier to play as.Overall STO is a great experience that is in no way P2W, you don't need top tier ships that cost real money to peform well, sure they help but you don't need them. Tier 4 and 5 ships can still be competitive once you hit lvl 50-60 and begin the endgame content.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Don\\'t get me wrong, ARK is a fun game and it is unique in the fact that your tools include the Dinos and other annimals, however i still can\\'t recommend the game due to the simple fact that the Devs are currently (in my opinion) more focused on adding new features that have bugs associated with them than fixing the ones that are currently in the game. It ruins the experience if your constantly finding bugs that may be small still ruin things or make the game frustrating. Another major concern i have is that you need a pretty damn good rig in order to run this, i can usually run all my games (Steam and non-steam) at their highest settings, ARK however for whatever reason i have severe trouble to run on even its lowest settings. Now i know some of you will go \"Get a better rig\" well that doesn\\'t solve much as it is the job of the Dev team to make the game accessible to as many people as they can, and in order to do that they need to get on top of fixing and optimising the game rather than adding more features. so no i can\\'t reccommend the game IN ITS CURRENT STATE, however if the Dev team is able to address the many issues with this game and do something simmilar to what Space Engineers is doing right now, where the devs arehalting addition of features and are just focusing on fixing the current bugs, then i\\'d give it a positive review...'}]},\n",

This game offers very little new content, with half the assassins ending up being overshadowed side mission that don't do the characters justice.The game itself is still quite good, with most of the core mechanics remaining the same. Movements, expecially grappling and gliding are a little off, and the combat (with the City approach of 'more guys = harder) starts to show it's flaws when surrounded by 20+ enemies.Overall, this game still has a very solid core to it, and should definitely be played. Yes, it is the weakest in the series, but that is because the first two were so strong. Some of the elements of this game are nicely done, just pretend multiplayer doesn't exist though. Writing (although I personally did not like the story) is quite nicely done, and everything about this game still holds it's own.The weakest part of this game is that it is the third in a series, and it is definitely a step backwards. If this was a first up game, we would still highlight the flaws but could see the room for improvment. The sad fact is that there have been two games already that have overall been better. But I do encourage you to play this game, because it is still the same engine and gameplay as the first two - and that is still a damn good thing.\"},\n",

With over 100 levels, dozens of unlockables, lovely visuals and a wonderful soundtrack this game is a really delight to play.The premise is simple: get from one end of the level to the other in a free-flowing smooth run. But this game is not for the people who have slow reactions times or get frustrated easily. It is hard, and quite unforgiving. Repetition is going to happening in this game, but because of the quick reload and charming music, it's hard to feel put out.When you do get a great run going, it's fantastic. All the notes and melodies stiched together with your actions makes it a grand way to know you're doing well. Not to mention that it also helps timing your moments with the logical note progression.Over the multiple different worlds, there are retro levels, multiple paths and different bosses to change things up, and the dastardly combinations of different moments makes you really appreciate the level design - which may appear simplistic at times - but it very finely tuned.This game is great in short bursts for those that don't have much time, it's great for those wanting a challenge, and especially if you like the recognition for seamlessly stringing together your levels and actions. Everything about this game screams that the developer cared about making their game. From the cutscenes narrated by Charles Martinet (who also does the voice for Mario) right down to the charming animations and fluid movement.This game is something you should seriously consider purchasing, playing, loving and then realising that you have to do the whole game on all three difficulties and then all the extras and then costumes and then...\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Not the best shooter, nor will you have the \"funniest\" time you can get out of an FPS. If you‚Äôre looking to have fun with mate or just by yourself, play, BF4, COD (Not ghost) or B2. I found that the actual shooters elements of the game is dull. Yeah, you got skyhooks and things around you, which are very handy, but the amount of enemies I had to face was annoying and at times, boring. You also can only have 2 weapons at a time. But what I did like was the power ups, which all had different uses. But for half the game I used like 2 of them, which I think they\\'re is like over 7 or something. So why is this game so good? This game really shines, and is utterly unbeaten, with its engaging storyline. What a story, I never thought a game could engage me and make me care about the characters like this. I kept pushing on the average shooter because of this story. Also, there is a lot of freedom for the play, or as it seems. The graphics is more than good and the city is really awesome to, which you get to explore bits and pieces of the downtown dark alley ways to the wealth and good looking streets, parks, houses and more. So overall, this game is a masterpiece in its own right, and has defiantly set a new started in terms of storytelling games. (P.S. The ending will blow you away and I played most of this game on the PS3)8.5/10'}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"I can't describe how much I love this game. There is an amazing amount of polish and balance, from the visuals and the strategic depth, all the way to the raw and dirty visceral depths that combat can descend to.Let me tell you about the combat; It is good. My most memerable battle so far was a 2v2 where I aided a weaker captain vs a bandit, only for a high level bandit to join in.Bandit capital ships are weaker but they have an insane number and reserve of strike craft, which increases by level (not fighters, those are different). My ally engaged the motherships while I thinned the swarm but he was being overwhelmed, so I rammed the strongest enemy and kept thrusting to push him away (ramming is a big mechanic, more on it later). Freed to 1v1, my ally succeeded in destroying the first pirate, but at high cost; his shields down, his nose and two wing modules torn off and floating free, a core destroyed and his health but a sliver. Sensing blood, the swarm of strike craft pounced. There was nothing I could do to save him. He exploded magnificently, destroying many of his attackers who were too slow to flee.The remaining pirate and I circled while exchanging broadsides, each deadly piroette bringing us closer to a field of asteroids. His strongest weapons were on his nose and he fought to bring them to bear. I, meanwhile, was slightly more manoeuverable and clung on the the relative safety of his rear, while picking of the remaining swarm. Our shields failed at the same time.Shields, armour and hull are not just 3 interchangeable stats in SPAZ2. Shields are the most familiar, a flat, regenerating, protective field. Armour is different. Every single non core piece of the motherships have their own armour, some of which is shared to the core. If a part loses all its armour, it is torn off, and sometimes destroyed. Hull, or health is only relevent to the cores of the ship and when that is gone; boom. So unlike other games, it isn't destroy shields>armour>hull with various piercing weapons, it is shields>tear them to pieces or shoot straight for the core.We tore each other to pieces. I took his right wings out but clipped an asteroid at speed, destroying my left. Caught against it, he was able to bring his nose to bear, shreading off my remaining wings and one of my engines. Now he was more manoeuverable.In despairation, I boosted, smaller asteroids tearing into my hull until I placed a large one between us. Frustrated momentarily, he stopped and reloaded. Seizing this last opportunity, I came out of hiding behind him, my last weapons pounding his engine, trying to even the score. But it wasn't enough. He began to turn and rained fire on my last engine. Before I could be left helpless, I once more boosted, this time straight at his exposed engine, knocking it into the void while my nose crumpled and exploded.Both helpless now, no engines, but still he had weapons and he slowly, ever so slowly, turned to bring that hateful nose to bear. With nothing left, I had a moment of inspiration and grabbed the astreroid chunks with my tractor beam. In space, surrounded by the refuse of awesome technology, I beat him to death with a rock.A narrow victory, I collected the refuse of our 4 ships to just bearly rebuild 1, and then jumped to the void.All actions described above REALLY ARE IN THE GAME. If two things collide, they do armour type damage (very weak vs shields, weak vs hull) to eachother based on their mass and speed. If you can get an enemies shields down while yours are still up, boost at him/her, smash their bits off! Beware of ramming with your shields down, as you can wreck yourself. Finally, you can rebuild your mothership WHILE IN COMBAT. A wing came off? Try and grab it before it goes to far, and reattach it! Enemies powerful weapon came off? Remove your own and replace it!Did I mention I love this game?Also, there are so many viable ways of building your mothership, and none are perfect for all situations. I keep parts in storage to swap forms when dealing with different kinds of threats (General flying, starbases, pirates, mining) but my general form is the ION shield ram: Huge shields/thrust and some ION weapons or lasers to take down shields so I can ram them. It is weak to strike craft and starbases however, and is hard to mine with.\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Guns of Icarus Online is a First Person Western Shooter that is horrible in every way possible. This game is obviously a failure of a Call of Duty clone. The level up system seems to use unrealistic millitary ranks. I mean, what the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is a \"Powder Monkey?\" You also lack the ability to prestige making replayability nil. The weapons.... Oh dear. You don\\'t even get to hold the guns. They are mounted onto your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• vehicle and the aiming is horrible. Most guns don\\'t even have ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing iron sights. And here it comes.... the worst part... the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing sniper rifle. You heard me, sniper rifle. There is only one of those in the game and the idiots that made the game called it the \"Mercury Field Gun\" thinking it sounds cool or some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Well it doesn\\'t you filthy hipsters, just admit its mean\\'t to be called the L96A1 Bolt Action Rifle. Oh yeah, I forgot. ITS NOT EVEN BOLT ACTION AND IT ONLY HAS 2 BULLETS. YOU ALSO LACK THE ABILITY TO DO 360 NO SCOPES. WHAT THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• DEVS LEARN HOW TO MAKE AN ACTUAL GAME!!!Overall I give Guns of \"I-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed-your-mother-hard-last-night-carus\" a 420/69 - IGN.'},\n",

       "    'review': \"Really fun if you like street racing games or a good challenge as this game can provide both. For a game released in 2003 it still stands pretty well today and even has a whole modding communtiy to back it up to keep the game interesting. I find this game to be really replayable as I keep coming back to play the through the game over and over again. Although it may be somewhat short, I find it just adds to the replayability of the game. The racing itself gets pretty fast paced when you get out of the first hub world with features like the burnout, nitrous and wheelies (for bikes) to keep you getting back up to speed pretty quickly. The open-world combined with open checkpoint style races allow for the player to go their own route through the races (or at least to the next checkpoint) or just follow the AI. Because of this, however, most races might require multiple tries to be able to learn the race beforehand and know where you're actually going and to take the optimal route to win. Trying to do these for the first time can sometime prove difficult as the races get longer and checkpoints are spread further out, which is where some of the difficulty comes in. Also that you have to use your current vehicle to beat people who are using vehicles of (most of the time) better performance. This isn't necessarily a complaint from me as the feeling from finally finishing first after many tries is amazing, knowing you can finally move on through the career. My only complaint is the bloody traffic; the most annoying/frustrating part about this game. I don't know if I just have really bad luck or something but it seems everytime a traffic car 'swerves' out of the way it always ends up swerving right into me as I see everyone pass me in that instant. Also when random long busses like to go across intersections right when you happen to be crossing perpendicular to them. But besides that, I absolutely love this game.*ProbablyJustANostalgiaFanaticReview*\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"Seeing such a great world full of potential in this game. Everything about the game play is great so far. U get to craft, u get to build stuff, and u get to raid and such. But currently this game is ruined by hackers and bad community management. Dun get me wrong, i'm in singapore and almost all the server i've played in has hacker, all the asia server has hacker. all the western server too lag to play. Official server, the name shd make ppl scared to use hack or ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but no. there are tons of hackers, ruining the game, u go out, gather resource and get some good gear and suddenly out of nowhere a guy with speed hack flash right infront of u, jerking left,right up and down, and seemingly just smack u to death with a rock, and not once but 4 times. so i said fine, i'll go to other part of the world, bam, aimbots and wall hack shooting from inside a rad town wall. Go to community server? no, admins hacking, admins not bothering about hackers cause they are friend and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. so unless garry and his team solve this problem, this game is a no go for asian gamers. (Pro Tip: just ban china, they are the major cause for hacking)\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'This is a great game. with a single problem that could maby be fixed. the problem is simply because of the way the game seems to generate the levels to match the music is programed to generate levels based on 4:4 timing  (i dont know how to type that the correct way) so if you have something that is in a different time like 3:4 then your may not get a good level, the game does inform you if its not comfident in the timing. granted this may not seem like a major problem but i think if it was fixed it would allow more songs to be played well, and possibly making more people happy with the product. but i give the game 7/10 and if this could be fixed/coded into the game then it would get a 10/10 from me np.PS i know my Grammer is something terribal.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'One of the best games I have ever played.However it is not for everyone, here\\'s why.So Hyper Light Drifter follows a charecter called \"The Drifter\" or \"The Magician\", a blue skinned guy who has a kickass sword and can dash and kills stuff! The story for the most part is hard to follow if you dont pay attention and because there is no dialogue it isn\\'t dropped in sort of easy to pick up hints. Instead when you talk to people you are shown still images that tell a short tale. From what I can tell the story is \"You\\'re part of a race called Blue-Skins, who did some bad ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and are hated. You are approached by Anubis/The Jackal who is supposed to be god, he asks your help to fight an evil called Judgement, the Jackal makes sure you do this by giving you a disease that will kill you unless you help him seek out and destroy Judgement!\"Tl:dr You\\'re a smurf who needs to help a dog god kill a big black thing, also you\\'ve got cancer.The game itself has a lot of big pro\\'s and con\\'s that will likely affect your decision on buying itPro-Amazing art style-Amazing music-Difficult gameplay-NG+-No dialogue-Pretty cheap price when on sale-A few difficult achievments to work towards-Makes you want more high quality gamesCon -No Dialogue-Sometimes unfair and a bit frustrating-Only one story or way to play the story-Pretty short game-Makes you want more high quality games-Capped at 30 fpsSo I put some stuff in both Pro and Con, I doubt I have to explain why but I will just in case.Stuff like no dialogue are both good and bad, depends on the point of view.Anyway my final review of this is  8/10 Gameplay  6/10 story 3/10 replayability  7/10 Overall  Like Dark souls and Zelda violently ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing behind a bar '},\n",

       "    'review': 'Where to start? This game, is nuts! I am a GIANT clicker fan, starting with cookie clicker, to Adventure Capatalist (of what is more of an Idle game) to Clicker Heroes! But this clicker is my favourite.  Here\\'s why.1. It has AIMING! As with all bland games, aiming makes things better! Such as my favourite MMO of all time, Wildstar.So when this clicker had aiming I knew it was worth a \"Shot\". (Yes, that was a pun).2. It was based on one of the coolest games in the VR Universe, Time Rifters. To be based in the same scenery is a lovely trip to your brains memory compartment, if you haven\\'t seen that game, then it\\'s just a cool place to be in general.3. Its got great progression! Not at one point did I feel It was going too fast or too slow, and when I needed money the most, a Rainbow Money Ball would come along and help me out!So in total this is the greatest Clicker/Idle/Shooter of all time! If you are not sure, give it a try!'},\n",

But let's talk detail.This game is literally a dictionary stuffed inside cartoon graphics and zapped with story, and I'm okay with that. The story isn't half bad, the level design is fabulous and the graphics is eye candy. There are afew flaws, some times words entered aren't adapted and it won't help you spell your workshop creations (I happen to have made afew) so it can be a little tedious when trying to make somthing specific. Don't make somthing specific! Go nuts! I come back to it even with the story complete just to make some crazy stuff.

       "    'review': \"Very disappointing. Codemasters have taken a grant-bribe from Oculus to buy platform exclusivity. No reason this couldn't have been delivered using open source Steam VR. Codies' PR team are busy fobbing off questions about Vive compatibility with evasive corporatespeak drivel while, presumably, lighting Cuban cigars with dirty $100 notes from the Facebook coffers. What next? Games you can't play with mouse/keyboard control unless you're a Logitech customer? nVidia only software which refuses to run for AMD users? Software which only works on a Samsung monitor (thanks for the brown paper envelope, guys).It sucks, and is of no benefit to the consumer. The PC platform's strength is broad compatibility regardless of who manufactures the components or peripherals. This is the thin end of the wedge, and PC gamers should stand together in giving a well deserved collective middle finger to anyone involved in these shabby practices.Oh, and as far as the review goes, I couldn't play the game in VR because Codemasters were bribed into avoiding the de facto OpenVR standard in favour of locking down the hardware with Oculus' proprietory drivers, so....That's a huge thumbs down and a generous 2 testicles/10 rating for this one. Hope Codemasters choke on Mark Zuckerberg's baby batter...\"}]},\n",

Like, WOW! There are hundrends and i mean hundreds of quests. I'm not sure on the max player level but i got to 127 over the spand of 90 hours. The game might not be as polished as DIablo but i tell you. It is wayyy more fun. As far as the game goes it's 10/10 Don't expect anything serious because the story is crap and quests are not the greatest. But it is an amazing game.\"},\n",

You can also  lvl up  geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards. I have not seen many fps open world mmorpg's around and this is quite the package if you are looking for a game like this.\"},\n",

Regardless of how many times the game glitched on me or just plain disturbed me I couldn't stay away. The fast paced combination of shooting, running, driving, flying, skydiving in a panda suit with a chainsaw, I just couldn't resist the simple, mindless fun of it all.Screwing around in sandbox mode is certainly more exciting than a mojority of the story and that's OK because the game is simply incredible.Flawed and Unfaithful to the previous games as SR3 is, it is still a brilliant game and totally worth your money.SO BUY IT.\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Where to start. Well I\\'m in it so it\\'s guaranteed to be epic. All jokes aside though the game is awesome, and you can read my review to know more.The game overall is awesome, it\\'s like borderlands 2, but it\\'s better. The Scaling in BL2, was horrible from level 50 upwards. You need OP and Gamebreaking gear to get anywhere in the game fomr UVHM onwards. And I can already see the scaling in this game is a lot better. I\\'m able to now use Purple guns to defeat a raid boss, solo. The visuals, can be a little repetitive at times, but overall they are appealing and does bring different environments into the game. Now as for gameplay, well, many, including me who had seen the gameplay, thought that the butt-stomp ability would be a gimmick in the game that I would never use. I was wrong. It adds so much more to the combat, in addition with the low gravity, killing is a lot more fluid, getting around on foot isn\\'t so boresome, and depending on how you use your \"double jump\", and where you activate the extra boost, gives completely different outcomes. For example, if I need to get to a higher ledge, a jump and boost when i\\'m halfway until the fulcrum of my jump, giving me a way higher jump. But If I was to say get passed a very wide crevice I would start sprinting, jump then activate the boost before I start descending. And this all may seem simple, but it can be applied to the combat maneuvres and it overall makes combat more pleasing. I particularly like to use the second descripted type of jump a lot when traversing without a vehicle, it practically triples my movement time and comes in handy, even in the normal gravity environments, such as Helios.Now for Classes. Of course everyone started the game as claptrap, so i\\'m going to go and do something different like I usually do, I played the game as Nisha, speccing into her middle and right trees, and found myself being basically a god, maybe here is where the teamwork really comes into play. Having all 4 Nisha\\'s running around wouldn\\'t work, because you have no way of healing or buffing teammates. Nisha is a very combat centred solo class. And I would say she is needed for every kind of boss fight, she deals damage and deals it where it matters. Claptrap, is a must have, he gives the team random buffs, and helps out alot with co-op, lots of health boosts, dmg boosts etc. Athena plays the role of the tank healer, she is a great class to play as with friends, although solo not so much. Her abilities are a lot like Maya\\'s except she soaks up damage. She is also a vital part to the team, giving out lots of Health regen. I didn\\'t play wilhelm much, but from what I did, He is just a straight up tank class. He takes all of the damage dealt while dealing a fair enough amount of damage. He is the most Balanced class from what i\\'ve played of him but isn\\'t very fun (for lack of better term), So overall the classes have their own Pros and cons and they all do their own special thing that makes them vital to the team.As an overall, I\\'d say the game does use lots of content from Borderlands 2, including some legendaries and renamed Unique guns. The humour is a step up from Borderlands 2 and as an Australian I did get all of the jokes, so that could be a downside for some players who don\\'t know much of Australian slang and colloquialism. But yes, the humour is well done and implemented, the story is EXCELLENT. I love it. *No spoilers* I hate lilith for what she did to jack, and I empathised for Jack as the hours passed. Some of the negative reviews here state that the campaign didn\\'t give enough XP to get to the required levels, but that\\'s because they didn\\'t do the side missions, which were frankly better this time around. There is a lot more variety and SO MUCH story to be told in the side missions, like how Terramorphous made it onto Pandora, when Threshers where only a Moon Species (DAMN YOU HAMMERLOCK), or how Jack comes up with the idea of Moonshotting loaders to Pandora etc. Lots of things storywise are excellent, with a nice twist on Jack at the end and how he gets the scar on his face. The story just blew my mind the first time around, and I stuck around long enough for 3 more playthroughs up to TVHM and still find it enjoyable. I especially can\\'t wait for the UVHM pack that will have a new Narrative Voice over along with Tiny Tina. Overall Game was excellent.Now for a short list of Pros and Cons incase you don\\'t want to read all that garbage.Pros:- Story- Classes- Visuals- Soundtrack- Gameplay- Combat- Low Gravity- Enemy Scaling- Weapon Scaling- Replayability (I\\'d die if I didn\\'t put that in there)Cons:- Nisha and Claptrap are the only 2 classes that are really enjoyable in SP and MP- Wilhelm and Athena lack enough SP Skills to play SP, but are both great for MP- Not as many legendaries- Maybe too many reused Borderlands 2 Assets- Comedy can get a little dry after a whileAnyway that\\'s my Review of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel I give this game an overall of:8.7/10. It\\'s more of the same which isn\\'t bad, it still has that Borderlands Charm, it delivers where in lots of ways Borderlands 2 failed. And even though it seems mediocre amongst many giants coming out this year, it\\'s defenitely my Game of the Year. I can\\'t wait for the Doppelganger Pack release tomorrow, and like i\\'ve said many many times. This game overall is excellents. It\\'s a must buy for borderlands fans, and a must buy if you want to try out the series. TL;DR Game overall is excellent, more of the same Borderlands you love while changing it up a bit. New players will love it, while old fans will cherish it.'}]},\n",

Some PC gamers have a setup that is not easy to remove a joystick for various reasons, joysticks are not easy to disable on a window system. These new games see joysicks as a gamepad and use buttons and any axis across any or all of the attached joysticks and disable the keyboard alltogether making the game unplayable. Simple fix is dont downgrade PC inputs to suit a 10-15 button gamepad.'},\n",

While yes, the servers may not be perfect yet, the Devs are working hard to improve and perfect the servers. The Devs are listening to the community. If you take a quick look down to the negative reviews, they are active down the apologizing for their mess up. While they have implemented  micro-transactions, you do not need to buy anything. I do recommend it though, as it supports the making of future games for them. Overall, I give this game a 9.43/10\"},\n",

It was true at the time but since then the game has been abandoned by the developers, traded in for the PS4 version instead. They ceased development on the PC version and have since closed down the Australian servers, making it unplayable for anyone in the area (including myself). The matchmaking for other servers is garbage as well, taking decades to find a lobby.This game is trash now and I\\'m glad to be not installing it again after reading the reviews for the game, and now giving my own.

       "    'review': \"I played the first, completed to 100%, found it enjoyable, It's a point and click adventure game, I had no problem picking up the second, didn't hesitate at all, The second is just as fun, lots more reading, lots of random clicking to find things, The only problem, It's super grindy, It's like you need to grind everything to just pass one spot every time, whether it be fishing, picking herbs etc,There aren't too many quests near the beginning, so you basically need to complete them all to have enough fame to continue, I found this some what repetitive and unenjoyable, I was constantly going from place to place to get more and more items for one quest because It has the last bit of fame I need to progress through to the next stage.I played the first one without stopping, I couldn't, It was too much fun, the second however, I've taken several breaks, there's only so much grinding a person can do before it's tiresom and you just don't want to do it anymore, I found the need to complete things to unlock mushroom, eggs etc quite bad, usually you'd just click and it's unlocked, not having to do quests etc to get that ability. Overall, still a decent game and I'd play it over quite a few times, If there were more additions, I would not hesitate to grab, one of my favorite point and click games.\"},\n",

       "    'review': '- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW - ( Note, When I play this more (which I will), this review will change.I understand this is early access and has been for quite some time, I also understand bugs/glitches are always going to be there.I\\'ve been there the whole way through the greenlight, and I was so excited I could actually play it via steam.I\\'m deeply inlove with harvest moon, always have been, always will be, this is based off harvest moon, therefor i\\'m expecting it to be something quite like it.Overall, it has great potential, and when/if it comes out for 3DS/WiiU/Psvita, I\\'ll also be grabbing it on thus consoles i have. I know a lot of work has gone into this game, and a lot more hours will be spent making it the greatest it can be.Pro\\'s- Closest thing to Harvest Moon itself.- Love the details/graphics- Calming Tunes ( May get annoying after awhile )- Easy to waste a year of your life away- Early Access, ( room for improvement )- Somewhat playable- Playable via Steam- Fast and easy start up- many, many more, and I\\'m sure i\\'ll have more to add when I\\'ve played more hours.Cons; Annoying Features/bugs/Glitches I noticed. (JUST BECAUSE THERE\\'S MORE CONS THAN PRO\\'S, DOESN\\'T MEAN IT\\'S A BAD GAME)- Spelling Mistakes, such as, On the sign at the farm, \\'ax\\'. \"they\\'re reactions are similar\", The mayor says \\'they\\'s instead of they\\'d \"- overused words( Dear,Gotcha,Getcha ) makes it seem unprofessional when it\\'s there twice a sentence,- not too detailed about the actual things you need to know- walking through doors sideways and not where the door is.( On the mayors tour )- mayor disappears in the General Shop when first meeting- mistaken he/she at the farm when clearly accepted was a she.. and then says she in the next sentence.- \"they\\'re reactions are similar\"- random 0 when mayor talks about the animal attacks at the start- few music tunes from harvest moon(friends of mineral town+TreeOfTranquility). - First person to visit the farm repeats before roselyn/jessica shows back up- Massive random line of b when jessica shows the above view of town- sleep and save is glitched, Can\\'t save, - can\\'t sleep ( option comes up, is accepted and then nothing happens )- start is an hour long-  No sound effects ( tools, people, walking etc )- Farm Layout Is basically EXACTLY like Harvest moon ( No Originality )- Turnip Seeds glitching and becoming infinite at the start- Controls are bugged and seem to not work ( Interact Button, even when changed. Also Escape for back comes up with exit option, everytime. )'},\n",

       "    'review': \"- RECENT REVIEW -New engine, completely rebuilt, lots of updates, It's a pretty decent game again, although, having a beast computer is the only way to see the new engine at its best, It's too overwhelming on my computer, and i'm having trouble playing it with all my settings either off or extremely low.Its got lots of new additions, such as a completely new map, which is absolutely massive, and if you die without a sleeping bag placed, chances are you aren't going to find your spot again anytime soon if ever, horses, they're quite cool, and the deer, the animals are just completely awesome, except for the wolves, they could be downgraded, they run way too fast and glitch all over the place.all different types of building, wood, stone, sheet metal, reinforced, locks, cupboards, There's so many new features and additions, it's all had a makeover and is pretty.. hahaI guess it's a decent game again, depending on the server you play on, I won't be playing it as much as i used to, but it's a nice treat every now and then :)- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -I stopped playing a fair bit after zombies were removed and replaced with mutant bears and wolves, It just wasn't as much fun, I enjoyed finding an amazing server with a decent community, running around the map on resource runs and seeing who could headshot a zombie first, Zombies really were the highlight of this game for me, after that was removed, everything went bad, there were no decent servers, there were hackers, less updates, found myself and a friend just throwing flares down a hill and watching it roll, for about 3 hours, and that was all we did. Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D\"},\n",

Has been for months and will continue to be, I'm hoping there's a part 2, or a completely new game, the graphics are amazing, vocals are awesome, missions, hidden artifacts, tombs, wolves, good guys, bad guys, and that's just the campaign, I played for 13 hours, 6 and a half hours for 2 days, I couldn't stop. It's like finding a good book and not putting It down.buying this on sale would be a massive rip off, It's worth full price and so much more. People say nothing's perfect because there's always room for improvment, Tomb Raider just goes to show, Perfect does exist. Best.Game.Ever.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"I personally think War Thunder is a great game. But unfortunately it has it's downsides. I think i'll start with positive stuff, which is lot's.- The Graphics are amazing, but require a very good computer to actually get them.- Many of the sounds in the game are beautifully made and recorded, some of the best sound in any plane/tank simulator game.- Driving mechanics can be quite clunky, but are amazing when you get used to them.- Tank battles (arcade) can be pretty fun, especially lower tiers. Once you get higher though, it starts.....the bias.....the grinding......the broken game mechanics :(- Planes are great, but same as tanks, fun at low tier, not as much at higher tiers.Okay, now.....it's time for the brutal stuff._ *One day, Birdman Kreb's was driving his T-34 1942* While i was driving, i spotted a few enemy tanks and quickly dispatched them (surprisingly). I continued driving and ran into a Panzer IV, i also dispatched that (again surprising). Then i made the mistake and drove out of cover, and ran into a M4 Sherman. Now this is where the bull#### began. He fired on me and killed my entire crew 0_0. Now i would have been fine, if i didn't watch the replay. What i saw was, the bullet hitting my side armour (fired from the front) and hit the surface at an angle that would have made my armour more than 200mm (yes i tested this) and this somehow, bounced into my tank and killed everyone.(And if i ever get a pic of this, i'll put it up.)And yes i know about Russian bias and yes i hate it. Being in a kv-1 and taking 20+ hits from M4 Jumbo's and Stug's and a Pz IV, just seemed a bit crazy.Overall though, good game. Worth downloading (if you ahve a good computer).Just watch out for Russian Tanks, always aim for the turrets.Okay so i just out of a game, and i had my usual, T-50, T-34, Zis-30 and Kv-1. Only to be destroyed by an Su-122, that thing has a battle rating 1.3 higher than any of those tanks and is a tier higher, what is this matchmaking. >:(\"},\n",

Now my computers pretty terrible, so i'm surprised i can even get it to high graphics.-The voice acting, well what do i say other than, SHAMEFRU DISPRAY!-So glad to see AI soldiers actually attempting to fire over hills and such. Although i do miss the moments where your soldiers fire into the dirt.-Pretty cool multiplayer system, althought matchmaking 0_o. Pls, i don't want to be put against lvl 1 shogunates-Naval battles are pretty unique, especially fall of the samurai. Love the first person.-ALSO WHALES, THEY HAVE WHALES 0_0 OMERGOHD WHALES!Bad stuff :(-To be honest, the cutscenes could be better. But i enjoyed laughing at the rigid clothing of the emperor as he waved his arm around and the constant shocked look of some of the characters.Overall its a pretty damn amazing game, didn't think it could beat Napoleon (until i found the guns then i started blasting samurai all over Japan) Oh did i mention that there's actual WHALES. It's good to see some fish in the ocean, oh wait sorry, i mean mammals in the water. 10/10 would whale again\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Let\\'s start off with something, this game is amazing.When you first start off in the game your going to be put in a Battlefeild/Counter strike enviroment, choosing between two teams (Insurgency or Security), you will be faced with a detailed loadout selection and class selection. Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering \"should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead\". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can\\'t really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).'},\n",

       "    'review': 'The gameplays relatively the same as the main game but with more focus on branding uruks rather than killing them, but the main attraction is the One Ring which to be fair is OP againts warcheifs and makes them a breeze but i guess thats what the One Ring is, a ring of power. By far the best thing about the DLC is the final boss battle which isnt just QTE this time and   is really fun and takes around 20 minutes to beat (with about 1-2 deaths). The gameplay up to the end is a bit repetitive but the boss makes up for it.'},\n",

Great fusion of action points based planning with cooldown timer and real time action.(You get to activate a mode that freezes everything and allows you to plan moves, might not execute the way you want it exactly. Also a penalty of disabling all function use after activating said feature unless you have a modifier attached to a function.

       "    'review': 'Unlike its new sequel; Dark Souls 3, DS2 has done something that completely astounds players to this very day, something that made the game what it was. Around the launch of DS3 i would spend hours watching PvP, reviews and lore videos while i was saving for the game. One faithful day i stumbled across a review that changed my entire perspective on it, something so terrible i could not bare to spend a single dollar on that embarrasment that is DS3. The review simply stated some broken and missing mechanics that of which are alive and well in DS2. What are these key mechanics you may ask? To put it simply in a complete and utter overlook on fromsofts behalf, they managed to leave out the single thing that made DS2 so superior, so excellent. That mechanic my friend is Common Fruit.9/10 Hopefully FromSoft redeems themselves by readding Common Fruit in their new DLC and then maybe i will purchase DS3.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'this is actually a seriously badass game and would recommend it even if it was at cost, but its bloody FREE! although most of the in-game features such as new classes to play as, weapons to equip, cosmetics, etc requires actual purchase, but initially  you can choose between 3 base classes (each class is defined more or less by the 4 abilities its capable of using), a tactical class that uses abilities that effect the player themself, teleportation, decoys, etc, a second class that focuses all its abilities into offensive power, and a nuetral class that has some offensive and some supportive abilities, your first character is free but to get more classes you have to either buy them outright or find some \"materials\" and \"components\" to make them and then pay with an ingame currency that your earn from doing missions, its kind of rediculous and your just better off buying stuff, not to mention only some weapons and stuff can be bought with the in game currency, but the game itself is free, so i kind of balances out, and i guess this way you only pay for the things want, but overall you can still play the game to a full extent without paying a cent'},\n",

When you first start playing things can seem a bit overwhelming and especially if you're playing online not everyone is forgiving towards new players, but its definately easier to complete jobs online than with bots offline. the only thing that was disappointing was that its alot more work to create custom masks than i feel its worth, you need any combination of 3 components to make one: material, pattern, and paint. and the only way to get anyone of these at a time is as a random drop at the end of each completed mission, but you also have the chance of getting bonus cash, bonus xp, or a weapon mod (mods that you have to pay ludicrous amounts for to then actually use anyway, so thats another thing), but overall its an exellent game and highly recomended. dont feel bad if you're a lpw level, it doesnt take long to level up online and doing more difficult jobs with higher level plays who can carry you through jobs.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'bought it, love it. i invested in the nemesis bundle because i was afraid that i\\'d get stuck with a lame default mech, but the fact of the matter is it doesnt matter what mech you use, you can still win. i wouldnt use the term \"pay to win\" but if you\\'re willing to put in some cash it grants you quicker access to some weapons and perks than having to play for hours on end. the only thins you have to pay for are the cosmetics, everything that affects gameplay can be acheived by earning HC (Hawken Credits) which you get based more on play time than anything else, but you can increase the amount slightly by achieving a higher score in any given game mode. there is only one thing i think could be changed, i just feel like everythings a bit over priced when it comes to using the HC, its better than a lot of other games that have a dual currency system, but it could be better, especially since when you spend 3000 credits on a perk that only works on the mech you bought it for. Ultimately, i feel like the reward system is a bit harsh because you have to buy the same things multiple times if you want to use more than one mech, but other than that its a great game and i highly recommend it'},\n",

Mission settings such as \"onsluaght mode\" makes things interesting in the sense that you can have it off and run through the missions as intended and take your time, or turn it on to penalize slow movement due to massive hoardes that... well swarm... you every minute whether you move or not. Vast types of aliens keeps you on your toes and its a game thats overall pretty simple to learn (also has offline practice that offers hints or for you to test different load outs which is fun), then if you havent played in a while you can get right back into it, just like riding a bike'},\n",

On top of that, sooooo many errors with the lock-on system (which is necessary if you want to play a caster build), some of the worst hitboxes i've ever seen, enemy ai problems and large problems with the rolling mechanic (which is neccessary to the game).I'm not saying this is a bad game, i just want you to know what you are getting when you buy this game\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Im loving this game so much right now. This game takes the concept of super smash bros. (Punching people sensless until they disintegrate into nothingness) And spins it on its head. Basically instead of having an arrange of set moves you get 2 different weapons. This varies from character to character. I.e, Orion: Spear + Rocket propelled lance. You still have a predertermained attack patteren with light attacks. Signature moves (Heavy attacks) are different. They vary from person to person as well.Pros:-Addicting-Premium currency is for cosmetics that dont aid you-Free-Satisfying-Different game modes (custom game)-Controller support-Very easy to runCons:-Premium currency is used-No Australian servers yetThis game is simply amazing, and its still in early access!'}]},\n",

The fact you have abilities and stats for each unit (Orks being more offensive, while Space marines defensive.) and being able to attack pieces at range / if they are a terminator or assault marine they can melee adjacent units. I found some of my strategies failed because they would be bombarded by units. If this was the final game I admit I would be unimpressed but the fact there are plenty of other modes coming and a campaign and more. I think its worth it. But.... if you strongly hate chess then I wouldnt recommend\"},\n",

Not to mention its current inactivity of servers.... I WONDER WHY? its a horrible game in general, there are so many better games out there.Also I do not know this for sure but the menu looks like its stolen off Blacklight: Retribution which I would rather go into and spend hours apon hours on if it was a choice between the two.However for the time I didnt experience those issues it was a fun game... Until I noticed that there is nothing left to do after the missions other then mindless pvp that is ruined by what was mentioned above.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'Well part of me wants to reccomend it simply because the more players the better. However my game has come into issues (Just me so wont apply to you.) Therefore I havent been able to play it much, although the time I have played has been thoroughly enjoyable. I will warn you if you hate strategy and tatics and listening to teammates then do not get it. however if your looking for a more tatical and in-depth game then I will recommend it.Being australian does not help my liking to the game, theres only 3 servers for AUS. One of which has a password, the second is barely ever available and the third is a blast to play on. When its not full. Because when it is full you have nothing to do but bare with the >200 ping. However there are plenty of EU and US servers on there.If your still unsure, just look at some peoples playtimes :P while you definetly wont be able to get 1000 hours out of it since it isnt as active as it was, for $10 USD its definetely going to be worth the money if you can bare the extremely steep learning curve. Overall I still will recommend it because I go by the logic if I pay $15 AUD for a movie and get 2 hours of enjoyment, if I can get an hour for every $ I spent my money was worthwhile.'},\n",

It brought me happiness during a little bit of a hard time, which is amazing cause I sometimes stay in funks like those for a long time. They took an odd concept and executed it wonderfully for such an early game. There's a lot to do and different risks such as not having enough food, slimes escaping at the early net stage and those evil tarr slimes. There is also great reward, smiling slimes, a feeling of completing objectives you've set for yourself and just all in all happy times. Can't wait to see what else they add to the game. New slimes? New areas? New fruit? Maybe even different species of tarr. Buy this if you want a fun indie game to screw around with and can keep coming back to. 10/10 for reals\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Enter the Gungeon is a roguelike, top down shooter, similar to games like The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne. Each level/floor is randomly generated with all sorts of special rooms, combat rooms, secret areas, and of course the boss you will need to defeat to progress to the next floor. The game is perma death, meaning when you die your run is over for good, adding a bunch of challenge to the game. Gungeon has a dodge roll mechanic that is used to avoid bullets, and consumable blanks that destroy all bullets on the screen. These make the game a bit easier.There are many many different guns, buffs and active and passive abilites, allowing for heaps of potential synergies. The game is also chock full of cheesy gun related puns, and references to other games/tv shows etc.Overall this Enter the Gungeon is really fun, but it can be hard and frustrating at times.'},\n",

The notes at the end of each day is a nice touch.Apart from the minor bugs, I don't have any serious complaints about this game. Strong recommendation\"}]},\n",

This was great fun up to this point - until alll of a sudden - the updates happened. The diversity of different tiers and levels, dissapeared - the uniqueness of designs, gone - The all-round game play, terrible.What made this game so bad in the end, was the fact that they decided to take all the hard work, grinding, and time off all the users, and just deleted it. Sent everyone back to an abysmal tech tree which made a level 100 and a level 1 the same sturdiness (armour wise). And the devs didnt even refund those who lost their hard earned robots.The development team needs to recognise that what they are/have done has turned a great oppurtunity into a train wreck. This CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN IN REVIEWS. Unless drastic restorations to the game are conducted. YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME.'}]},\n",

The stealth is way to easy aswell like orcs are just way too stupid and the attract button makes the game way to easy.  The nemesis system is good either having like your own army withing the system or let the orcs fight themselves within the system and see how they progress within the army. Final verdict its alot of fun! messing around with the orcs the brutal final blow kills are brutal! and having to choose to stealth or run in like a maniac always keeps the game fun and entertaining i was just dissapointed with the story of the game.'}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'This is a great action packed game with great graphics!  It has three game modes including single and co op campaign with 6 different races. The campaign can be set on easy, normal, hard and very hard.  The second game mode is multiplayer. You can also choose of 6 different races and their costume colors. You can do many different things on multiplayer, for e.g: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 etc. But my personal favourite is Last Stand. You can choose out of 6 races (or 7 if you have dlc) and can the play on two different maps. You play with three different people and as you gain more experience you can make your character stronger by giving him armor, weapons, and traits and abilities. You should seriously think about getting this game!'}]},\n",

One of the aspects I appreciate most is the foundry: the freedom to create a DnD-esque questline and, eventually, campaign of your own! Granted, the game itself is awesome and a challenge* if you do it right!In other words: 8/8 m8*note: challenge does not account for everyone, it refers to the way I play.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"Chivalry is a great game and theres not much games like this around, I mean steam is over saturated with generic shooters that are not really unqiue in there own right, but chivalry studies the likes of the medievil times and the medievil times hasn't really been done in video games all that much,I mean you couldn't really count the elder scrolls games as medievil because there not there fantasy but back to chivalry, chivalry has some awesome gore splattering gameplay, some pretty good graphics and chivalry is just all around fun, if I could name some cons about chivalry it would be that In my opinon the price point is asking for a bit too much I mean you've got games like counter strike global offensive and garry's mod that's only 15 bucks and packs like a mind boglging amount of content, but Chivalry also has a bit of learning curve which is not a bad thing but it's just something to consider, Chivalry is an amazing game it's not perfect but it's a game you should definetly consider letting into your steam libary if you can find Chivalry on sale on steam definetly pick it up if you can you will not regret it (seriously you won't) it scores a 9/10 dismembered heads.\"}]},\n",

The story is incredibly well written and I grew attached to the characters It felt like my choices really mattered. The gameplay is incredible and intuitive and is quite challenging. The music is amazing and I havent grown this attached to an OST since Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. I havent felt this way about finishing a game since To The Moon and Solatorobo. I wasnt sad because of the story, I was sad because the journey was over. I cant recommend this game enough, easily an 11/10 for me.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'For a developer that does game development in his spare time, hes certainly done a good job with Bit Blaster XL, its quite addictive!The style is nice and the visuals are pleasant to look at, and the animations are simple yet fluid. The music is catchy but can get a little old especially when youre grinding credits for newer ships, especially since theres a song tied to each ship. The controls are a little stiff on keyboard but are a little bit better with a controller, it does make landing hits a bit harder (but that could be me only using the controller briefly).If you want a cheap and fun game to kill time then I definitely recommend this. Its also available on iOS and Android.-------OverallPros:-Nice simplistic 8bit inspired style-Nice music-Good controller support-Cheap priceCons:-Keyboard controls are a little stiff-Music is tied to individual ships and can get a bit repetitive when youre grinding credits for new ships.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'This game is surprisingly good, I recommend it if youre looking for a new coop game to play with friends or just a nice open world game mixed with parkour. Story (6/10):  While nothing special it does have its set of memorable characters. The main cast is pretty average and forgettable but the characters in the side quests are hilariously whacky and memorable. Graphics (8/10):  The game is absolutely beautiful and has flawless triple monitor support. You can see ripples on the clothing, grass and trees moving in the wind which only gets better during raining and storming weather. The facial animations on non story critical characters are a little stiff but the animations are pretty good otherwise.  Gameplay (8/10):  The gameplay is pretty good and the parkour is pretty smooth, it may be no mirrors edge but it still boasts a lot of similar parkour. The melee combat is where the game shines with upgradable melee weapons that degrade over time, you can get perks to help make your weapons last longer but even at higher level youre still watching your melee weapon usage. The gun play is pretty good and im disappointed the guns dont wear down Far Cry 2 style but it balances out since melee weapons do more damage.The night time can be absolutely terrifying right up until higher levels, my first experience with night time was an adrenaline rush even in coop.The game will feel very familiar to those who\\'ve played Mirror\\'s Edge and as a fan of Mirror\\'s Edge, i can easily recommend this game for those looking for a new parkour game. Controls:  I\\'m not giving a score on this since I played it on both PC and Xbox 360 controller controls, so I\\'ll write a mini review for it.The PC controls are pretty good but the mouse sensivity takes time to get used to (i really cant explain this problem) but it still feels very natural compared to most multiplatform titles. The Xbox 360 controlers however, are clunky and take a lot of time getting used to but still very playable ones used to it. Coop (8/10):  The coop is pretty damn good, its peer2peer and you join the client\\'s game and you do their quests and story. Its drop in and drop out so you can leave and join anytime. The \"Be The Zombie\" gamemode is similar to the Dark Souls invasion and can make even the most battle hardened survivors work together. I really recommend this game if youre tired of all the current coop zombie games like CoD zombies, Left 4 Dead 2 and Killing Floor. Technical Info:  This game isnt quite optimized for PC and my first 5-10 hours involved me having a problem where the cutscenes would run at 15fps despite pulling 40fps in triple screen resolution (5760x1080) and apparently its coming problem but looks like its fixed now (it happened to different people no matter the resolution or setup).The game has flawless triple monitor support and the side screens darken when entering cinematics. I recommend keeping \"View Distance\" at the default or turning it down because it has a major performance impact for little effect (it just makes foliage more visible in the distance, thats it).Apparently this game has very very basic Oculus Rift support but I havent tested it until they get something worth testing.'},\n",

       "    'review': \"TL; DR version: for $9.99, this dlc is short and does not add any real content to the game that you can not go without.Now for the long version. I got this dlc as a part of my season pass, so I didn't pay the $9.99 price tag. But if you didn't buy a season pass and are considering buying this dlc separately, I recommend you do not.There are really only two new characters with a decent amount of interaction introduced in this dlc. One I felt was developed very well, and will keep as a companion for a while. The other, was very shallow. There was barely any character development to make me feel anything for them. They could have been a no name raider and plucked at the same heartstrings during the big choice of this dlc.The robot customisation added by this dlc is quite neat. All of it balances nicely with no obvious power play options. And it's fun to have your own custom companion. But this, ultimately, is no different to any other companion. Sure, I can give them sword arms, but I could just give another companion a sword for the same effect. The interface is also slightly confusing; it is difficult to follow what change in damage/resistance a mod will cause without doing the manual check yourself. I was beginning to trust those little +++.Coming into this dlc with a lv 50 character (playing on survival) I really only felt challenged on combat at one stage in this dlc. That's not isolated to this dlc though, I feel fallout 4 has difficulty issues regardless. But this dlc does nothing to rectify this.Oh and if you're not a junk hoarder then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors amassing your new hoard if you want to build any decent robot mods.There are a few new weapons added in this dlc as well, with the majority being mele, then energy. These are not something a level 50+ is going to start using though. Even with full modification, they fail to pack any considerate punch.There are also some unique power armor mods added in this dlc, but they are non transferable and will only benefit energy weapons users.In the end this dlc adds some cool features to your settlement and a cool new companion, but other than that there is nothing really new that is worth the $9.99 pricetag if you're considering buying this dlc outright.\"},\n",

The game that you could buy here today is not the game that was promised, not the game that was shown.

       "    'review': \"One of the best indie games ever made. Spelunky is randomly generated done right. The game is always a challenge, and at the start may seem repetitive or frustrating, but the more time you pour into this game, time this game deserves, the more you will notice the complexity and fascinating level of depth the game has.GameplayThe game might not be for everyone, in that victory is not guaranteed and a simple mistake may mean restarting from the first level of the game. You play as a spelunker and a boiled down summary of the aim of the game is to get to the next level by maneuvering from the top of the level to the exit at the bottom, all the while avoiding a multitude of enemies and traps. Each playable character (and there are a variety to choose from) is equipped with a whip to kill enemies or smash pots or deflect arrows. Really it serves as a multipurpose tool.GraphicsColourful, vibrant and beautiful 2D art that complements the game perfectly. Pretty explosion effects. It is a nice looking game.ReplayabilityConceivably infinite. Every level is different as they are all randomly generated. It is highly unlikely you will ever play the same level twice and if you did you would most likely not notice as you'd be too busy whipping bats and jumping spikes and enjoying avoiding death.It took me 100 hours of co-op to beat the game with my brother and that was most fulfilling experience ever. And technically I haven't actually beaten the game yet as I only defeated one of the games bosses.Highly recommend this game. 10/10\"},\n",

It's fun, it's fast, it's infuriating and, importantly, it's rewarding.For only $10, Hotline Miami is a bloody steal.\"}]},\n",

Now im a pretty big gamer on warframe and have gotten pretty far within on getting warframes and weapons but when an update comes out you just better get on and see what is new for what you will get and even with this one it is just amazing with the new frame and the weapons that have been added into it. And also that not just weapons and a frame but also a new ship as well which is an improvement to having a new kind of ship which you will need to find the parts and buy the blueprint in the shop and once your done making it, you have yourself a new ship. This game will make you wanting to keep on playing and not stop so go ahead and grab this game and play it for yourself and have fun tenno, we are all counting on all of you'},\n",

       "    'review': 'Ok I just have to say this, I have once liked TF2 but after some time of playing this game i have slowly started to hate this game so much, reasons why you might want to ask me is that i have not really liked the admins of certain cervers (mainly the two pony cervers im on and some others as well) with getting new ones and getting rid of once good ones who i have actually liked. This game is also used for the shop which is used for the keys to unlock these crates that are usually what you might get over a nice weapon or a rare chance of a simple hat. But honestly do people really want to spend over 30 or maybe 60 but not even exactly 100 dollars on some stupid ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ring that no one will ever buy for unless they really wanted to spend it on that damn thing, I say no you can get anything you wanted thats not some cosmetic item for your classes to all wear but i say that these items that i have seen and the new things that have even appeared in this game are just useless, all you get are some weapons or the main thing of hats which i have seen over the time that i have played this damn game. But unlike other games i have seen or played such as CS:GO also do the same thing with the shopping mechanism of the keys and crates for weapons. But as for TF2 I would say that i wouldn\\'t even dare to touch or play this game even if they have made some good buffs but after that gunn metel update it just made it all go away for me and started to not even play it one single bit. Now if anyone would give me a single reason as to why i should play this game and i mean a good one not that \"its so fun and amazing and that you can play with friend\" just like any other game i have and that one of my friends have to play on i want a really good reason that you can easily persuade me to start this game up again once more and to prove that it will be worth my while then i will be playing it but otherwise i am not playing it worth anything even if i were to get an unusual which would cost me something or if anyone gave it to me for free.

It offers fast gameplay like Agar.io would, but, unlike Agar.io, it eliminated one of the things that made me say that Agar.io was bad. The lag. Other than that, Mitos.is gives more gameplay aspecs then Agar.io, these come in as Zombies Vs Humans, Free For All, Team Fortress, and a variety of others.Humans VS. ZombiesThis gamemode is where you play as either a blue human, or a red zombie, you infect others by shooting yourself at them (Using the W key.) Once a team has reached over 5000 points, a countdown timer will begin. Once the timer has finished, the winning team will  be crowned winner, and a new match will form.Free For AllFree for all is what you would expect, you play as a ball eating random things to become bigger, so you can eat bigger balls to become the biggest on the server.All In all, this is a good game, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to kill some time.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"So I've wasted 182 hours of my life in this game. Getting yelled at by my friends, Hiding offline, but it was totally worth it. There are so many things you can do in this amazing Open World RPG. At the beginning you can create your own character, which is kind of cool. There really is no ending to this game. You can play at your own leisure. Besides getting yelled at by friends and the case of the removals, this game is worth the money. If you ever get bored and/or beat the game, there is an excellent collection of mods at the workshop and a website called nexus mods. This game is highly recommended to anyone who is into open-world games or rpg's. But one last thing, as soon as you get the game, you cant stop playing it.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'As far as early access games go, I have to say you want to jump on board this one as soon as possible. Graphics, Gameplay, level design and even well designed AI make this game a hell of a good BETA. It will leave you with generally only one main complaint, and thats content.Now of course content will be lacking in an early access title, but grip has managed to create an experience where, even though there is only three maps for racing at the moment, each race will leave you with a different opinoin. This is thanks to level design, incorporating the abillity to drive up walls, take side paths (both of which are usually drasticly different) and landing good items and benefital positions.The Kaos of the race, explosions everywhere while you narrowly avoid rocks and ramps wizzing past you, while dust sprays from the back of your tires all the while trying to keep an eye out of the player infront of you, makes this game really really fun. If you apreciate the intencity of a race, this is perfect for youLong story short, you will pick up this game thinking \"This game has so much potential\", and at this rate, I think it would be pretty hard to screw up.'}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"Great concept, but extremely bad execution.What was fun: social aspect and level of co-op either with friends and matchmaking (sometimes).What wasn't: unprofessional dev attitude, rushed release hence bugs, glitches, and hackers. To top it off, loot system is extremely broken.Avoid this on PC, hackers galore. Developers have had no concrete response to tackling hackers. In fact hackers have no fear playing this and posting their hacking videos on YT. Developers enforce a 3 day ban followed by permanent ban but are being circumvented by hackers simply changing their names. Glitching has been rampant for a while now, and no actions have been taken to resolve this issue also, which means most people are OP in PvP. There are also so many bugs relating to connection, the quality of servers are intermittent at best, while several of the talents do not even work. In fact, sometimes they are the oppostite. The attitude of Ubisoft and Massive are: close threads down of anyone posting any negative feedback, while communicating the absolute minimum: the silence indicates that this game is in trouble. The fact that vendor blueprints are more exciting that loot drops is alone a sign of a completely broken game.I thought I'd be proven wrong by forking out early and getting the GOLD and Season pass, but I regret this. Apart from the extremely brief social co-op experience this game provided, the only other positive that I've gotten out of this game is to never every buy a game and season pass that Massive/Ubisoft have laid their dirty little fingers on.\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'The McDonald‚Äôs we‚Äôve known for more than half a century is changing. Whether due to shifting market trends or a mid-life identity crisis, the Golden Arches has decided to completely reinvent itself as an upmarket restaurant chain. It‚Äôs a bold new direction for the company with a focus on premium ingredients, dine-in perks and customer creation via ‚ÄúBuild-A-Burger‚Äù touch screens.

Whether due to shifting market trends or a mid-life identity crisis, the Golden Arches has decided to completely reinvent itself as an upmarket restaurant chain. It‚Äôs a bold new direction for the company with a focus on premium ingredients, dine-in perks and customer creation via ‚ÄúBuild-A-Burger‚Äù touch screens. Yesterday, we tested the fancy new service at its maiden store in Castle Hill, NSW. The results exceeded our wildest expectations.Study the above photo. It doesn‚Äôt look like your typical Macca‚Äôs fare, does it? Remove the tell-tale cup and it could almost be a burger from a glitzy steak house or high-end pub. What you‚Äôre looking at is a bespoke burger packed with an Angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, egg, smoked Applewood bacon, red onion rings, jalapenos, grilled mushrooms, chilli jam and no less than four types of cheeses. (Yep, I went all in and I don‚Äôt regret a thing ‚Äî but more on that later.)This is what McDonald‚Äôs wants to become in Australia and it‚Äôs pulling out all the stops to make it happen. While the service is currently only available in a single Castle Hill outlet, the company is embarking on a nation-wide roll out over the next two years. Consider it the final step in McDonald‚Äôs hipster gentrification (hipsterfication?) ‚Äî a process that arguably started with the Angus and M Selection range.So how does it work? If you just want to grab a quick ‚Äòn‚Äô dirty Big Mac, McDonald‚Äôs will still cater to you via the usual ordering process. However, there‚Äôs also a touch screen kiosk where customers can get a whole lot fancier. There are several ready-built deluxe burgers to choose from, although the emphasis is firmly on customer creation.There are more than 30 ingredients to choose from, including two types of buns, four kinds of cheese, two types of bacon and a range of specialty toppings including grilled pineapple, guacamole, beetroot, grilled mushrooms and a range of gourmet sauces. Handily, the display automatically tallies the kilojoule count of your order after you‚Äôve added all the toppings.The touch screen interface has been built to impress: it‚Äôs large, responsive and easy to navigate with visual representations of all the available ingredients. With the possible exception of geriatric Luddites, the UI shouldn‚Äôt give customers any trouble. (Trained staff are hovering nearby just in case you have any questions.) You can also order standard menu items from the touch screen, which means you don‚Äôt have to split from your lunch partner if they just want a Quarter Pounder.Once you‚Äôve made your selection you can pay for it instantly via an inbuilt credit card terminal. You‚Äôre then presented with a receipt and invited to sit down as your meal is freshly prepared. It will then be served to you on a dinky wooden platter. (Plastic trays are for bogans, dontcha know.)The new menu doesn‚Äôt look like fast food and it doesn‚Äôt act like it either: waiting times are significantly longer than McDonald‚Äôs customers are accustomed to. It took close to 15 minutes for my order to arrive by which point I was completely famished. Mind you, this is fairly typical for a non-fast-food burger so I won‚Äôt begrudge them too much.Just be aware that you might be in for an even lengthier wait during peak meal times. The manager I spoke to admitted that things can slow to a crawl when lots of bespoke orders come in at once. If your time is limited, our advice is to show up at least an hour before the lunch/dinner crowd.When my burger finally arrived, I was immediately impressed with the size and construction. If the ready-made options are anything like this, we may have the first perfect Takeaway Truth score on our hands. But looks can be deceiving. For as long as anyone can remember, McDonald‚Äôs has been synonymous with cheap, bland food. Would this be more of the same with a higher price tag?The answer is an emphatic no. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best McDonald‚Äôs burger I‚Äôve tasted by a significant margin. It may even be my favourite fast food burger, period. The combination of familiar Macca‚Äôs meat and gourmet toppings went together wonderfully. My only reservation is that it was a bit hard to eat due to its massive size. Annoyingly, McDonald‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt include plastic cutlery with orders unless you ask.Apart from that tiny caveat, I really don‚Äôt have anything mean to say about this burger or the upscale service that spawned it. Would I pay $30 for a version with the lot? Of course not. But for $15 or so, this is a perfectly acceptable meal ‚Äî attractive, delicious and so very filling.In conclusion, McDonald‚Äôs has clearly realised it needs to adapt with the times and it is moving confidently in the right direction. Fast food just got a serious upgrade. Colour us excited.'}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"Get it!Especially if you've watched the anime. The anime is one of those rare exceptions where it's better than the source material (this visual novel), but the visual novel has a lot of different scenarios and endings that aren't included in the anime. There are some translation errors but they're pretty easy to figure outI recommend watching the anime first then playing the game, but that's really personaly preferrence, it really doesn't matter. Just what I'm used to.If you end up getting the game or watching the anime (or both), prepare yourself for some deep ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. As in, I ended up writing down notes to understand the story. It's great. Anyways, get the gameEl Psy Congroo\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'This game has been an extremely big let down, to explain my point I will use a metaphor. Games are like pools, minecraft for example is \"infinite\" and has enough depth you can put your head under while standing, and most AAA games are, quite deep and take you on an journeys regardless of how \"large\" pool is. And to put plainly NMS is kiddy pool infinite in size. Extremely simple and impossible to do more then one or to things with. Although on its own this game would make good early access $30 game, but the slew of missing content raise more questions then answers we have ever got from the Hello Games dev team e.g Planets orbiting, ships class system, naming ships, flight control that isn\\'t a form of dumb down auto pilot, the depth and complexity of the crafting and elements system. Now based on what versions of the games with have seen threw trailers and \"gameplay footage\", it\\'s looks as if the game has now become extremely simpler then the version we are playing now. Some reddititors have gone threw the footage from E3 and the likes, and have said that what we saw was very likely a real version of the game based some key artifacting that could of easily been removed in a pre baked animation e.g AA although this isn\\'t 100% confirmed yet.This just my opinion, but it looks as if NMS has been effected by its need to run on the PS4, with the potential of Sony pulling strings forcing Hello games making the game simple to reach wider audiences and there for more buyers.With all this in mind it is best to hold on to that $60 USD till one of these things happen:1. They update the game bringing it closer to the E3 versions and promises made.2. They reduce the price, justifying the content or lack there of.3. A better and cheaper game that is similar comes out'},\n",

Fnaf3 is packed full of challenges and hidden secretes, but this does not take away from the story or corrupt it. i like the feature of the devices failing and the hallucinations are awesome! People think these games are a one scare game you buy and leave, but it isn't because of fascinating story about the children murders and the fun and unique game devices. i rate the new installment 9,5/10. I only wish that sometimes your deaths are cheated.      CANT WAIT FOR FNAF4!\"},\n",

For all the conspiracy theorist  out there that want proof of UFO's come play some war thunder plenty of UFO's here. But seriously the grind in this game is by far the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•est I have ever seen. It takes sooooo long to get one plane or tank. The game is almost forcing you to go premium just to progress through the tech tree. If only the devs listened to us.. and wearn't a pack of greedy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Also devs the AAA isn't a s500 missile defence system so nerf em a little ffs. I can honestly say that I have wasted 400 hours on this game.

Truly an amazing game that puts you to the test with every encounter. 11/10 would buy again.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"Firstly im sad saying this but this game does get boring after you play it for 250 hours also dont play alone this game is so very boring when you dont have someone to play with. Second of all I believe that this game is extremely fun when you first start playing because you are in a first person shooter and a class based system which i completely think that is a great  idea because NO one likes playing a world wide multi-player game with only everyone using the same 'class'. Last but not least if your worried about being hacked dont be this game is very secure and believe me everyone I know has never in their life been hacked on this game because it is so secure.-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Z_k50ltkY\"},\n",

But seriously this game is extremely interesting with loads of different content every day and endless fun. I have really had some amazing times with friends on this game on Dark RP and Sandbox because of people that put effort in making servers and addons.-Confuzzled'},\n",

If you like AC games, play any of the far better original ones, like AC brotherhood, if you are new to AC games, don't let this poor mockery ruin your view of the series. EVERYTHING has been sacrificed to make it co op. Combat has finally been made slightly harder, but is now ruined due to parries and dodges working maybe 50% of the time, and having common street brawlers fight better than an assassin is pretty pathetic. the renowned fps issues and other strange glitches are really just another layer of incompitence on top of the already poor excuse for an AC game. Ubisoft, go back to Brotherhood, everything in that game is better than unity is today, and that game is many years old already\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Terraria, it evolved much, so every major update accours each year, on June probably.This is my favorite game of my life. im glad that i buyed it. it is the best game of steam ( my opinion ), i do play everytimeThis game, is a 2D Sandbox, worth to buy it. You start with an Copper Shortsword, Copper Pickaxe and Copper Axe. 100 HP and 20 Mana. I Can tell, there is alot of youtubers that almost do only terraria videos. Examples: Yrimir, HERO, Chippygaming, TerrariaHelp, meetyourdemize, then others. You can build alot of things, and get even much stronger that you started, or even, get all of the rarest items on the game, also it has support to mods and texturepacks. I Highly Recommend this game to everyone that is thinking of buying or not.'},\n",

You then recount events from each of their points of views and play out events in the past, affecting their futures, Got it? Good.Pros:+Good voice acting+Longer length ( about 2 hours and 30 minutes )+More interactive combat sequencesCons:-Too many jokes-Story is all over the place-Towards the end things stop making senseIt's a good debut for a new game from Telltale. If you liked previous games from Telltale you'll feel at home. If you've played Borderlands 2 expect to understand some references.\"},\n",

A thirty-something year old man on his way to prison for an undisclosed crime. The game begins with you getting driven out of the city of Atlanta by an elderly policeman. This is a tutorial of sorts as you learn how to look around and click on objects of interest. You also learn about the dialogue system in which you get given 4 options of words/sentences to reply with. Choose as you will, the copper looks away at a bad moment and crashes into a pedestrian, spins out of control and tumbles down a steep ditch on the side of the road. Dazed, confused and hurt you pass out for a few minutes to the sound of screaming. This is where the game really begins. I won't spoil much but this is a really enjoyable game. 9.5/10 is a score that this game earns exceptionally.\"},\n",

Aliens appear all over the place and it's up to the main character ( Gorden Freeman ) to get to the bottom of it, and if possible stop it.

Lets start with defending or attacking a town, when spawned, you arn't in a small town, you're in an open field map which just takes away the excitement of attacking or defending that town, only when your in a city you'll get your own map and siege battles can happen. The worst of it when defending is even if you have a general setup guarding that town and you get attacked you dont always spawn with your garrison units! they'll just be reinforcements! and at times they even spawn behind the enemy which can completely ruin any strategy, where's the logic in that? i've put 120 hours in this game and played on legendary difficutly and not once when an enemy has my city sieged have they ever attacked, they simply just wait for the attrition to kick in after numerous turns or wait for me to starve, thats pathetic. Chaos Warriors & Blood Pack, Big nono, this is content that should have already been included in the vanilla game! Don't get turned off by comments above, hopfully these problems will be addressed in further patches. Overall it's a good game, and I dont have time to list the pros!\"},\n",

Yes this game has been in development for years and is still in alpha, but it's not a cash grab! Visit youtube and search Joel Huenik's chanel, every single week for the past 2 months he has posted videos about the progress and upcoming features of the game while also answering forum questions with a Q&A video. While people complain about it being poorly optimised i have not yet had any problems with it however, A15 is focusing on optimisation while adding loads of new content, the console release was a bit buggy, but the devs have already fixed the bugs but cannot patch it because they are waiting for playstation to give them the all clear, all this is explained by Joel himself.The game is fantastic, and i look forward to every video and every new patch / Alpha that comes out, so if you're into survival games, this is one done right!Check out Joels videos for yourself!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrUPm0uNQgiPRos3TYOpEA\"}]},\n",

Out of the three DLC packs that come with this game, only the Far Harbor DLC campaign had a decent load of content, that's somewhat enjoyable to my perspective. However, that isn't going to stop me from recommending other people to avoid buying the Season Pass of Fallout 4.When you look back into the downloadable content that is seen from both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, they actually provided a hefty load of replayability and fun factor with the DLC campagins coming from both these games. It's definately no doubt that I've enjoyed a lot with Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in terms of the standalone games and the downloadable content.At least for me, I was able to buy the Season Pass of Fallout 4 on its initial price of almost 30 US dollars before Bethesda Softworks suddenly increased the price to almost 50 US dollars for some reason which I don't get.But take it from me, if you are really going to purchase the downloadable content from Fallout 4, it is wise to think ahead first if it's really worth it to consider buying Fallout 4's DLC.\"}]},\n",

This game is made for people who are 18 years and older. The question I have is why is this game a \"low violence version\" it is only for people 18 years and older. I understand its because its pretty full on. Being an adult means you have access to Uncensored stuff, adult movies, guns, etc. But why is this game censored for adults who paid good money for something that should not be censored. The logic makes no sence. Even the South Park TV show is Uncensored at MA+15. Why Censore a game at R+18? This is absolutely Outrageous. ITS SOUTHPARK. COME ON. PATCH IT SO IT IS UNCENSORED!'},\n",

       "    'review': \"Banished ReviewSteam Release Date - 19 Feb, 2014Genre - City Builder, Strategy, SurvivalDev name and status - Shining Rock Software, IndieAge Rating - N/AWorth it? Yes.TL;DRBanished is a challenging (but fantastic) city builder which strays from the rest as it is not your typical city builder; instead of huge capital cities that we see in games like Cities: Skylines, Banished focuses on a small town with a low budget. Personally, I think it is one of the best games in the city building genre. That said, however, the AI of the villagers is rather mediocre, and at the moment there isn't a whole lot to it's (beautiful) bones. This game can provide hours of good, challenging fun, but don't come expecting anything like Cities: Skylines. Also note that this game is very hard, and may be frustrating to those new to the genre, even experienced city builders will also need to have a few tries to get used to it's somewhat complicated mechanics and challenge. Banished has a bit of a lack of tutorials, so don't expect that you will understand everything right away.Banished is fantastic and challenging, but don't come expecting another Cities: Skylines.After many tries and hours of understanding every little mechanic, I have finally formed a functional city with a good population. Yet in this game, someething, small or big, will fail, and everything will completely go down hill. That is the thing with Shining Rock Software's 2014 city builder Banished, there is and always will be an underlying threat. Whether it's famine, cold, a natural disaster, your town will eventually go to the pigs.Your town starts off with a few small, hopeful families, a storage barn, and a stock pile with not a hell of a lot of starting resources. You start off building a few small wooden houses, you make some gatherer's huts, forester lodges, nothing too big. Your town will slowly grow in population and size, and soon you have a city on your hands. However, don't expect it to be a Cities: Skylines type thing where you can just sit back and watch your city work, you need to keep your eyes on the game at all times. One time I had a town-wide famine, because the road from one of the gatherer's huts to the storage barn was too long. Couldn't understand why everyone kept dying of starvation. While it is occasionally very frustrating, it is a very addictive game, and sometimes when everything goes bad the game really shines. The dire need of resources, the feeling of hope, the game will immerse you. So, lets get into the pros and the cons.Pros-Addictive-Challenging-A blast of fresh air-Cool art style and general feel-Interesting seeing your town work and grow from the teamwork of all your villagers-Immersive-Lots to achieve and work to-Relatively simple-Pretty good map generation settings-Weather cycles which can mean life or death-Lots of different ways to approach things; you could use a gatherer to gather food from the forest, use aquired seeds to make farms, or maybe just buy all your resources off the trading post, you can decide-Villagers aren't just lifeless robots, they have needs and happiness which can be fulfilled in different ways-Natural disasters are a cool feature which you need to prepare for-Gives you a good overview of statistics in your townCons-Villager AI is mediocre at best-Not great control over a few different things like villager paths and resource management-Not a hell of a lot on it's bones yet-Lack of tutorials, just throws you in the deep end-UI can be a little hard to navigate-Some resources like rocks are not unlimited, and will eventually run out (this takes a long time though)-Annoying little bugs which can destroy your cityWell, that's basically that. Banished has a fair share of cons, just like any game, but I personally think it deserves a solid 8.5/10It serves as a fantastic ant farm simulator as well, seeing your people evolve and grow, seeing them get all wiped out (fun). It is one of my favourites in the city builder genre and any experienced city builder should pick up this game, but even newbies to the the genre can pick up this game and have fun.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Surprisingly, it\\'s a really rather good city-builder*disclaimer, long and detailed review, skip to bottom for final verdictI got Tropico 4 in a humble bundle, kind\\'ve only wanting the other games in the bundle. So there it sat in my vast Steam library, not really doing anything. And then, my friend told me about a really good city-builder that he had been playing. I thought, \"oh Simcity, right?\" Wrong. He was talking about Tropico, (Tropico 5 however). At this time, I had forgotten that I even had it. So, when I looked it up on the steam store, I realised that I already had it. So, I gave it a shot. And I was quite presently surprised! So, here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of Tropico 4 and there reasons.Pros+Each little person has their own profile;What was one of the elements that made Tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around, doing there daily routine. Once you clicked on them, a profile of the character came up, explaining their age, wellbeing, faction, name, where they work and where they live. It would also make the camera follow that person. Sometimes, I would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end.+In the population, there are structured families;A little more of a unnecessary part of the game, (but undoubtedly cool) was the structured families. Sometimes when checking people\\'s profiles, you may find a group of people with the same last name. At first, I thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in. But then, I executed a guy, and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged. Confused, I looked at the effects of executing someone, and it said; \"victim\\'s family will become enraged\" and thats when I realised, there was families, which is really cool!+A system where technology evolves with time;Much like Civilization V (which is an utterly fantastic strategy game), technology would advance as time goes on. This means, that I might start out with some crappy tenements, but when I research more stuff, I could have super high-tec shopping malls. Nuff said.+The ability of extreme POWER;In this game, you have the power of anything and everything on the island, (apart from the rebels, which we will get to later). None of the decisions will be made for you, you have to make them. There are recomendations for what to build, but I mostly found myself ignoring them, as sometimes they can screw you over.+Rebels;The rebels system in this game is rather good. It\\'s simple, when someone becomes too unhappy with the island, they will become a rebel. Rebels can and will screw you over. They will start fires, attack buildings and people and generally become out of control.+Disasters;Perhaps copying other citybuilders, this game has disasters. Dont worry though, you won\\'t be having meteors or aliens or...dinosaurs *cough*Simcity*cough*. Just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes. And it won\\'t just be mildly annoying either, it will seriously screw you over. Once, when I built my city next to a volcano, thinking it would look pretty cool, lets just say it wasn\\'t cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and I went financialy in debt.So, thats the list of things which I think are pretty cool in this game. Now, we will talk about the cons.Cons-Limited time;The thing I can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game, even in sandbox mode! Sure it is a while, but one time, I built a really great city...and then I couldn\\'t play anymore because my \"mandate had run out\", and that was on maximum time. Sure, it adds realism, but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is. This is where Just Cause 2 shined, now you might be thinking, \"what the devil, what on Earth has that got ot do with Tropico?!\" well, my friend; nothing. I was just bringing it up. Anyways, the reason Just Cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic. Tropico should get some inspiration off that.-Lack of help;One of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with \"build a city\". This is a large downside, as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things. Alot of the time, I found myself looking at my amount of money, going down by the thousands, completely confused why.-Graphics;Now, I would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem, especially considering it\\'s a citybuilder. But the graphics are a little lacking.Final VerdictSo, we are down to the final verdict, and, if you couldn\\'t already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on, I most certainly recomend Tropico 4! Even though it has flaws, I can still say this is a great, solid citybuilder. Thank you for taking some time to read this!'},\n",

       "    'review': 'This game gets worse and worse over time.The developers constantly add new stuff, which allways breaks the previous updates and overall makes the game unplayable.Lets take plasma guns, you used to be able to have +1 overteir guns, about 4-5 of them built around a weak robot. Now that you can\\'t overtier at all, the plasma guns can\\'t do enough damage to be effective in battle at all.  Tis is because of these previous \"updates\"1. Damage nerf. (acceptable at the time)2. Damage nerf & removed dynamic airm reticle. (acceptable at the time)3. Damager nerf then boost4. Shot nerf (prevents more than 6 guns fireing at a time (acceptable as it was the same for all guns)5. reloading nerf, more guns equal less shots per minute. (acceptable as you could over tier for extra damage)Now with the no overtier rule Plasma now are completly useless as.1. you can only shot 6 plasmas balls on tier, that can do maybe 4-7 blocks of damage2. if you have more guns it\\'s pointless because they still won\\'t shoot, but you\\'ll lose maybe 4-5 guns from getting shot at while your plasma\\'s reload.3. SMG\\'s just rush you maximising their time at max DPS ripping you to shreads.This update made me un-install Robocraft.Do not bother with even testing this \"free to play\" game.'},\n",

       "    'review': \"Rogue Legacy is a really fast-paced challenging but fun game to play whether you're a casual gamer or an addict.So you go to the castle... and die. Then you get to take a pick of three heirs to continue your legacy. You choose a near-sighted dyslexic mage. He dies. Then you choose i gigantic gay paladin who then goes to the castle. He dies. Then his colorblind   dwarf daughter goes to the castle. She dies too! After many many generations of odd-traited heirs, your great-great-...-great-grandson who has vertige and is scared of chickens beats the first boss. It makes you feel AMAZING.After experiencing about 47 generations of heirs i got the hang of the game. You will too.This game is really different from other games on steam. It is a twisted version of a rogue/castlevania game, and the nostalgia will hit you when playing this.I DEFINITELY reccomend spending the $5 to buy this game!!!    9.5/10\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"Dark Souls IIIAn atmospheric adventure allowing you to have different 3 endings in total.As the Dark Souls franchise has always been punishing if you were to do something incredibly stupid.But despite on how much I liked the previous installments, I do not like this one.The main reason is the poise system, accordingly Bandai Namco / From Software have said it is working as intended.And yet the description of said feature is not how it works.In Dark Souls I poise was a big part of game play, for casters and heavy builds.In Dark Souls II poise was altered to a good degree to make some of the PvP a little more bearable for when a Dex build vs Strength.In Dark Souls III however, it is a completely useless feature that has split the community into 2 fragments. People who think poise was an OP feature for heavy builds, and then the people who thinks it's complete bs.Heavy armor's main advantage was Poise, allowing you to withstand hits without flinching, or slightly so untill you're staggered. Clerics, Sorcerers, Pyromancers and Warriors alike, were all hindered by this change to the 3rd installment.To this degree, you might as well as start off deprived and play through the entire game as is, or atleast use the Master's attire because armor reduction does jack all.I'm am gravely disappointed in Bandai Namco and From Software\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Basically Dead Island v2.Better graphics, good voice acting, story just good enough.The parkour system here is on par if not better than Assassin\\'s Creed but in firrst person. Everything is fluid and simple.The combat is less \"rewarding\", the early weapons suck even more than in Dead Island and progression is a bit slow. You\\'re punished via Stamina much more heavily.There\\'s a better leveling system (think Oblivion) you gain XP is different categories as you just run around and kill things (agility/combat/survival), the skill trees have depth.The performance is ok. It gets really bad outdoors (40~) and even those on high end SLI 980GTX\\'s are reporting the same frame rates. Needs some patches for performance, but I haven\\'t noticed any in-game bugs so far.Co-Op actually works. I dropped-in games fine, and people dropped-in mine. Night time allows for PVP (someone can attack you as hunter), but you can turn off this mode if you get annoyed. Online can be set to private, friends, public or off.I haven\\'t played enough to give this a score.'}]},\n",

Would I recommend this game to my friends currently, maybe depending on whether they can deal with the micro transactions, would I recommend this game if the micro transactions were removed or even balanced? Absolutely. Hopefully with this game being in early access, they will respond to the community‚Äôs gripes with them and remove them, because this game has potential to be good, real good.

Honestly I like it, for an early access game it appears to have a lot of content, and it runs smoothly even on the highest settings for me. Though there are microtransactions at the moment, the devs have already told me they are trying to rethink the way they will do this due to popular demand. I made a video of it, I planned to stop at 30 minutes but I just got that into it that I ended up going for an hour. End of the day I would reccomend it, though I havent tried multiplayer as none of my friends have it... yet :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6j9mm3Q6cA'},\n",

       "    'review': \"I have never seen a game like this one before, to be specific where the one who is chosen as the hunted can quickly become the hunter as a lone wolf against 4. The graphical details are amazing and I really enjoy the scenery aswell. Playing as the Monster at first was a little tricky, however once you find a routine you can win almost every time. PLaying as the Hunters, well it is quite literally relying on teamwork to bring down a monster, no mattter if the monster is level one, two or three. But having said that hunters are fun to play because of their 'individual' abilities and I really like the way they have made them all unique in some way shape or form.The only bad thing I have to say about this game is that it's gameplay and styles once you have been playing alot really does get repetitive.To sum this up, combined with the gameplay, the details, the hunter and the monster uniqueness and then taken into fact about some gameplays being repetitive, I will rate it 8/10 and people, it is definately worth trying out :)\"},\n",

I would suggest even for those who aren\\'t that keen to grab the game when it comes on sale ($3.75) as you can make your money back, just from selling items you get in game for free. This game is what is fuelling my game purchases from now on. Besides from that, it\\'s a great FPS, but is more then just a FPS. It uses strategy, teamwork, and commitment, all of which have resulted in a (mostly) good community. It\\'s also has custom features, so you can choose your weapon skins, and can buy \"DLC\" packs that support community modders.  And to finish it off, it\\'s got continued dev support, so it will (hopefully) only get better.'},\n",

Unlike other economic strategy games which are broad (\"Build a Farm\" - what sort of farm? Pig farm? Cow Farm? Ladybug farm?) it is much like stronghold, in the way that it is more specific for each category (E.G you can choose a weapon factory, furniture etc.) although that does come at a cost (just like in stronghold) as it limits the amount of categories there are. However this does not impact on the game. Suggestions? The AI is extremely easy, and you can almost never loose an election. Buy this when on sale. Plenty of fun.'},\n",

       "    'review': \"This game will put your swear word vocabulary to the test. Fun and intriguing with a story that isn't force fed to you. Combat is very precise and very rarely feels cheap or unfair. There is large game world with many interesting and breathtaking environments that are filled with a wide variety of enemies from grotesque monsters to heavily armoured warriors.I also liked the multiplayer aspect. Seeing shadows of other players, interacting with their bloodspots on the ground to see how they died, getting summoned to another world to help slay a boss, and getting invaded by other players. PVP battles are incredibly tense, the tactics that worked on NPCs don't always work with players, and you know that the oponent you facing is no novice gamer. Perhaps not as revolutionary as Dark Souls 1 but it's still a very challenging and enjoyable experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.9/10. Death is just the beginning\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'I have nothing better to do with my time, so here is a review for Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit.I\\'m not gonna lie, but the gameplay is actually pretty decent, you play as a cop driving in your Lamborghini cop car at 200 km/h smashing other cars until they get \"busted\", (which is an overstatement as their wreck of a car rolls over 5 times and off a cliff seems pretty much like murder to me) or as a racer, trying to avoid getting wrecked by the police or other cars and getting across the finish line.The graphics are pretty nice for a 2010 game, the cars look nicely detailed and the shadows and reflections look superb too, the only thing lacking is the anti-aliasing, which kinda ruins some details of the game. The driving in this game feels a bit weighted, and the handling feels like you are trying to steer a bathtub with wheels. The drifting is pretty bad, as tapping the handbrake sends you in a slight drift that sometimes can be hard to get out and send you into a car, or tapping too much or holding the handbrake sends your car spinning out. The driving only missions where you have to do nothing but drive your car to the finish are way too long and tedious, and you will probably spend most of your time doing these, as they take 4-5 minutes, and you have to do them anyway to unlock more missions. After you complete these missions, you may feel like you don\\'t want to play anymore as you spent 5 minutes of your life just driving a god damn car like you would in real life (unless you drive into other cars and into walls), in a video game.Speaking of missions, once you play more than an hour, you have experienced pretty much all what the game offers, except if you keep playing you just earn new cars and equipment upgrades. As of right now, I have not finished the game and I probably plan on not doing so. Also another annoying feature is the rubber banding of the police and racers. You can be as far ahead as you want, but the police seem like they have quad turbos with boost installed and will always catch up to you.The crashes in this game are pretty spectacular, as the game is made by the Burnout developers, Criterion Games and I feel like this is probably the best selling point of the game right here. If you are like me and enjoy watching cars crash in video games, then you can consider buying this game. There is nothing more satisfying than sending a car roll down the road and seeing the heap of metal stop dead, especially if the car costs more than your house.I have only played one game of multiplayer and I have probably experienced half of it. I only found one person (I am from Australia) and I was convinced that he was a hacker. I played as police, and he ignored all my roadblocks and spike strips and literally passed through them like a ghost. I also think that he was using speed hacks and was pretty much untouchable as he zoomed by me. This part is probably why I am going to not recommend this game.  In the start of the game, it asks you to sign up or login into an existing EA account. Me being stupid, I put in the wrong email associated to the account and it made me an entirely new account with an extremely generic name that I cannot change the name of. So every time I want to play this game, it always asks me to sign up or sign in and I cannot get around that other than putting in a fake username and password to ask if it wants to start me offline and it bugs the hell out of me. Also I found out that it  FORCES  you to use a microphone and webcam, so they basically breach your privacy while you play. The only way around this is, is to disable them if you dont want them to be used.I alt+tab out of games alot, and for me, I found out that my fps drops significantly to about 10-20 fps if I alt+tab in any part of the game, even the unskippable intro scene (which is also annoying). I don\\'t know if other people have these problems, but this is a heads up.Overall, the game is pretty decent, good graphics for a 2010 game, one of the best crash physics, sub-par steering and handling and if you find people in multiplayer, (which i doubt) then I hope you have a better experience than mine. This game gets really stale if you play for too long, so I recommend to play it once in a while to get your racing fix. I would probably recommend this game, but shame that these problems had to occur during my playtime.I give this game 6/10'}]},\n",

Everything worked nice. A bit tiring on the steering as for a tight turn, you had to move the stick a metre but I'm sure that will all change.I got a little sea sick, but nothing I couldn't handle. Funny thing is, I stay on my boat 3 days a fortnight and never get sea sick but some VR games just get to me.Comfort rating would be a 6 out of 10. Great work. Stick with it.\"},\n",

The movements are slow enough that you don't get motion sickness but still get to pilot the time machine like a sub.The graphics are pretty and feel realistic.A controller is the best option for an emmersive feel. I use the Xbox wireless.I will buy this game as it looks like it has a full story mission to follow.You play sitting down so very comfortable for long sittings.Demo is around 5 minutes long.Ai reminds me a bit of portal. Hope thay keep it light and funny.\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"I loved this game. It was really fun with friends, I didn't even mind the microtransactions as much as other people though they are by far the worst point of the game.My problems started late 2015 when I started to realise that my hard drive was full. I do, like a lot of people, have a lot of other larger games installed so I checked them to see if that was pushing me over quota. They weren't. I then checked some of the smaller games, one of which was Payday 2. It now holds the record of being the largest game that i've ever installed, and since every new microtransa- I mean, 'update' they add puts another 5gb-9gb on my disk, I decided to uninstall.The microtransactions, while I didn't find them irritating at first, now they are holding the game down. The GOTY edition helped, but 'helping' a problem and 'fixing' a problem are two different things. On a 75% off sale, the DLC is $33. Unacceptable. Don't get me wrong though, this is a fun game, and I've sunk 257 hours into messing around with mates as a result of that. But the things that turned us away from this game are the over-priced microtransactions, the high file size and repeated broken promises made by the lying developers that we used to trust and respect.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"TL;DR at the bottom of the page.The graphics are a major upgrade to KF1, not the main point of the game but still nice to have none the less. The gameplay to my knowledge hasn't been changed much, and thats not a bad thing. Solid and addictive gameplay mixed with the graphical upgrade makes for an even better game then KF1.Even though this game is great, its unfinished. My personal favorite class from KF1, the Sharpshooter, isn't avalable yet in KF2. There are also other classes that are new to the game that havn't been implomented yet like the gunslinger that I badly want to try, but sadly they arn't avalable yet. Hopefuly there will be a update soon that adds in new classes, and a haloween sale so I can buy cheaper.TL;DR:Is the game good? Absolutly 100% yes.Is it worth $30? Debatably yes, depends on the date and upcoming sales.Would I reccommend it for $30? Absolutly, but again, this depends on the person.Will I buy it for $30? No, but only because haloween is right around the corner (review written on 24 of oct) and im hoping it'll go on sale.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"LiEat is an example of a game done properly. I absolutely love it. The artsyle is charming, the music sets the scene nicely and the story, while sometimes lacking, is overall extremely well written. The one complaint I have with these three games (yes, you get three games for $3), is that they are too short. I completed them all in under 4h, and then proceeded to re-play the games a few times to get all the achievements, and for my own personal enjoyment. Fantastic value for the price of a chocolate bar, it's too bad that Miwashiba will not make any more of these. LiEat IV is a light novel that you can find with a google search, but Miwashiba stated that she won't make any more games. It's just too bad that such a fantastic developer doesn't want to make any more. I would buy any LiEat game in a heartbeat.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'This little, extremely inexpensive arcade game is worth the entire $3 I spent on it. In all seriousness, this game has been with me for a while and I have gifted it to a few people in an attempt to get the highest score between all of us, not an easy task. This game combines addictive chiptunes with BRUTAL gameplay that will make you want to smash your head into your keyboard, then pick up the remains and stab it. Multiple times. Who ever thought surviving one minute could be so difficult? Obviously not me!Pros:-Addictive gameplay-Competitive gameplay for the highest score in your group-Great soundtrack-Wonderful color palette (in my oppinion)Cons:-Too short-Once the patterns are memorized it becomes significantly easier-I only find myself playing for about 30-40min at a timeRating: 8/10. Easily one of the best and cheapest arcade \"compete for a high score\" games I have in my library to date.'}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community.The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot.But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that.'},\n",

You've removed the graphics options, thus making it impossible for me and others to play, the tutorial does't work, my game crashes all of the time. I have a new-ish PC, but because i'm almose broke, i have an old graphics card. It works fine with everything else, but with one of my (used to be) favourite games, you, Bossa Studios, had to sacrifice that.Pros--Fun Game-Enjoyable-Good in Early Access-Fun conceptCons--Unplayable for some people-Crashing due to to high of a SET graphics quality-Very low frame rateOverall, I do reccomend this game, BUT don't buy it if you have a less-powerful PC.

       "    'review': 'Like every game it will have its Pro and its Cons, Its Up and its Downs and whatever equals Positive and Negative. Bleed is a small 2d platformer where you control the character known as Wryn who wants to become the Greatest Hero of All Time but the heroes have already been chosen so you have to go and kill them and take you rightfull place. It is also a fast-paced action platformer which involves loads of bullets and enemies being thrown at you while you while having bullet time and control over your character at which in no point in time is trying to screw you over. The Game also and upgrades and weapons that you can purchase with points by playing the levels.With everything but the kitchen sink coming towards your general direction it can be quite difficult trying to avoid it and you will die quite a bit at the start (Either I just suck or I\\'m telling the truth) but unlike most games where it insults you for dying, it doesn\\'t really do it in Bleed, Infact half the time Wryn is actually conforting me for my loss saying things like \"Don\\'t worry we\\'ll get them next time\"The Bullet time mechanic is really quite neat and helpful and also quite balanced. There is a separate bar for bullet time: Using it in short bursts will allow it to recharge a little and you will be able to use it again, Use it untill the bar goes to zero and you will have to wait untill it refills again to use bullet time once more and that could involve getting hurt when you needed it the most.I\\'ve also noticed the game is very generous in check points meaning it will not send you to the very beginning of that room or level, it\\'s as if the developer knew that it might be a tad bit difficult on players. Now I can\\'t really explain how it all works but just play the game and you will see what I mean.The soundtrack in this game is fantabolus (yes I purposely did that) there is not a single song that I didn\\'t like. It fits in with the enviroment it is placed in and it has that old school 8-bit feel to it, especially the boss music.There is also Co-op in this game, I don\\'t anyone else to play with so yea :C but I had a look on youtube and it\\'s quite nice. Still don\\'t know how it works but it looks good.I have no complaints about this game: It has great fulid control, awesome soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay, a good challenge and a good price. There is however one thing that I am not fond of and that is the length of the game. while there are other things like arcade, challenge mode and other difficulties to play on, I just find this game to be a little to short and could have been better game than what is already was but hey, don\\'t let that stop ya from buying this game cuz it is worth the price.In conclusion I think that this is a great game to play and I had fun every single second of it and for 4.99 Its worth it all the way.........Well what are you waiting for? Go buy it already!'},\n",

       "    'review': \"This is as close as I'm going to get in regards to have Scott Pilgrim vs the World on PC. That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.It's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the lessPros: -Music-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode-2D graphics look gourgeous-Gameplay-Stages are really nice.-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)-Skill Point system-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.-Making combos is awesome.Middlepoint-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.Cons-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies. -You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.As you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me. Though I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale like what I did.Overall I think the game gets a 7/10. Not the best but no where near bad at all. Bad is not a word you would describe this game with. (maybe the controls but I digress)\"},\n",

My computer is fairly decent, not the best, but decent. It says that my computer can handle it on the specs info but it doesn't. I recieved constant freezing, crashing and choppy and generally terrible fps (with all settings down the lowest and some additional launch parameters, which was a desperate attempt by me). So if you computer is good, you're fine but please keep what I said in mind. Thanks.\"},\n",

Cause half the time you dont know if \"it\" is coming behind the corner. Some things i do dislike is the the enemies are poorly done, even with such good graphics, the faces are like a raccon attack there face, then again half the time your running away from them XD. the story is good but halfway it starts to chop and change and it can become confusing, also getting trapped in a corner is a proplem-escape is not possible.even with those dislike it is very good, well thought, and stole my sleep.i give it a solid 7/10.'}]},\n",

Ele jogou o cigarro que estava fumando no ch√£o e falou que nunca mais ia fumar e se esfor√ßou muito pra cumprir essa promessa, infelizmente, tr√™s anos depois ele morreu de c√¢ncer de pulm√£o. Foi muito triste e realmente me destruiu por dentro. A minha m√£e desde ent√£o ficou me dizendo: ''Nunca fume. Por favor n√£o deixe sua fam√≠lia passar pela mesma tristeza que seu av√¥ n√¥s fez passar''. Eu concordei e prometi a mim mesmo nunca fumar. Aos 22 anos, mesmo ap√≥s muitas tenta√ß√µes, nunca toquei num cigarro. Devo admitir que me arrependo profundamente disso, porque este jogo me deu c√¢ncer de qualquer jeito.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'O que dizer sobre este jogo que ainda esta no early acess e ja parece jogo pronto, durante minha jogatina n√£o contei nenhum bug, ou qualquer coisa que me atrapalhasse no game, e com tantos patches e updates, da pra ver que a produtora ta dando toda a aten√ß√£o pro jogo. Lembra levemente dayz, s√≥ que travado em primeira pessoa. O sistema de armas e muni√ß√µes √© um pouco dificil de entender, esvaziar cartuchos, juntar muni√ßoes, etc... Mas com o tempo pega o jeito, esse √© o tipo de jogo que da vontade de jogar mais e mais. Pra falar a verdade, n√£o achei que esse joguim de 10 reais ia me satisfazer, mas assim como How to Survive, esse jogo me surpreendeu, e vai ser o motivo de algumas horas gastadas daqui pra frente!85/100 comprem logo'},\n",

       "    'review': \"This game, for me, was a real gem. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of puzzle games that involves a stealth mechanic, but with the unique mechanic that is the 'Crosslink' system, the game becomes a lot less of just waiting and moving and waiting and moving, but instead becomes more like setting up a complex mouse trap that incapacitates every guard in the building with the flick of a switch. And that's where the fun comes from, not the hiding and the stakes of being found, but trying to find the quickest and easiest way to the objective through utilisation of the environment. The story is clever, well written, but short. the level design is top-notch, and with the implementation of a steam workshop supported level editor, I can see a much longer playtime through the various community levels.Oh, and you get a TF2 hat.So, even if you don't like stealth games, there's a demo that you can test the water with. And you never know it might just be that one good game you never see comin.g\"}]},\n",

The gameplay is extremely creative and that you can do anything using the three heroes, from making boxes and planks to jump on, to grappeling yourself and doing circus acts, to charging your way through boulders and throwing Thor-like hammers. In my opinion, this game is best experienced with a friend. I highly recommend this game to anyone.'}]},\n",

If that does not hook u in there is also a very \"fun\" multiplayer section which i can grantee that no one plays that mode. all jokes aside i strongly feel that u should play this game as it is really fun to play espically the customisation of guns though sadly cant customise your own personal gun like fallout 4 but however its there.This game is really more of a story base game so if ur the type who like mulitplayer good luck \"almost\" no one plays that mode.still i rate this game 69/10 so if u excuse me i need to use some tissues for something private'},\n",

       "    'review': 'Ok, this is my new review after reading a bunch of other players reviews. I have noticed a lot of negative reviews that say \"this game is bad because Queue times are long and not enough players\", that is not to the problem, these people are the problem, they dont have enough patience to wait for the player group to get bigger so queue times are short. This is a game where you have to be in it for the long haul to reap the rewards as such. I highly reccommend this game as it has great controls and is generally wonderful. It is rather accurate representations of historic ships, such as the tier 9 battleships, Yamato(Japanese) is strongest in armour and damage but rather slow, Iowa(USA) is fast with less armour and slightly less damage, the H39(German) is a mix of both, only one that is slightly out is the british Lion because that was a WW1 Battleship so it has had to be \\'promoted\\' to be a tier 9. All the ammunition is correct as well, such as torpedoes do lots of damage and allow the hull to be breached, thus slowing the enemy down(this can be repaired by the enemy). However, the one problem i find is that the developers turn a blind eye to hacking, yes there is hacking in this game, which ruins it at times. The hacks are basic ones for now, none that increase damage or instant kill ones, but mainly to do with scouting ranges. If enough people report it im sure the developers will finally get interested and try to fix it.THIS IS NOT A P2W GAME. I must say that, yes paying money helps to get things such as advanced smoke (this lasts longer than normal smoke). However, you do not need to spend any to reach high tiers, I myself have reached Tier 9, almost Tier 10 and havent spent a penny on it.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'For new release game this has started off well, it has lots of potential. 2 different modes, arcade - slightly aided in a way for fun and people who are still learning, then a second mode which gives the player more control over there plane, much more hands on. This game is good and I love what i have played of it. it is very challenging however because i play using controller. Im not sure if its just because my controller is an xbox one or its the game setup but the control sensitivity is seriously twitchy, even on the lowest setting (0) it is almost impossible to get a smooth steady turn going. Even the slightest flick moves your plane about 10 - 20 degrees around a circle, this makes targetting a dodging plane very hard. Also it is slightly laggy, my laptop isnt the best, i will admit, this won\\'t help, but your planes movement is juddery, move your controls and your plane sort of \"jumps\" across the sky in small leaps. Even on the lowest settings it is still the same.Finally, dont come into this game expecting some HD quality with magnificent details, trees exist but are more or less just blurry green things, buildings are super basic looking and its generally looks like a game from about 6 years ago. Slightly like GTA San Andreas quality with a tiny bit more clarity.I reccommend this game alot, definite potential to take top spot as best flying game/ WW2 plane game out, however, i suggest you wait until they fixed it up a bit and slightly improved the genral gameplay and controls.'}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'Not too long ago I wrote a review of this game. I accused it of suffering from a \"terrible lack of content\", primarily due to the fact that it only had \"4 classes, one which was broken\" (Zerker).I dare say that I\\'ve played enough of the new update to wish that I\\'d waited until the patch had been released before giving this game a negative rating.This is due to the fact that yes, Tripwire did take a long time in releasing it, and yes, there was a lack of content in time waiting for the new update, however, I can honestly say that it was all worth it.Every second.The new content is incredible, the Zerker tree has been completely re-worked, and it now functions as well as any other class in the game. The FLEX Gore system is beautiful (THE GIBS, MAN, THE GIBS).The new maps are unbelievably well-done. Catacombs is an underground area (as you\\'d expect from the name) where almost every light can be destroyed, plunging the map into almost complete darkness. It is claustrophobic, nigh on terrifying when played on the hardest difficulty, adrenaline pumping, and indescribably enjoyable to play.Evacuation Point is just as well done, but it isn\\'t as original as Catacombs. Whilst it is beautifully made, with some lovely tight spots to get stuck in, there is little that differs it from the rest of the maps, whilst Catacombs is one of the most unique maps I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of suffering through.The two new classes are absolutely spectacular. Firebug is fun in a maniacal sort of way. Setting countless Zeds aflame with the Flamethrower and watching them writh around as they slowly burn to death always succeeds in elicting a psychotic grin on my face. The Microwave Gun is just, beautiful.Simply beautiful.There is nothing more enjoyable in Killing Floor 2 than watching a Zed inflate spectacularly before bursting into a satisfying shower of gibs and bodily fluids. And then there\\'s the Demolitionist. Whilst the class could do with some re-working (it is a tad underpowered currently), I can\\'t honestly say that I don\\'t enjoy laying down C4 at chokepoints and waiting expectantly for a group of Zeds to walk by before blowing them all to smithereens, their intenstines flying all over the place, their blood splattering the walls as I giggle with glee behind the keyboard. Ahem. Aside from the brilliant new content, there were numerous bug-fixes and other improvements present. Namely, Tripwire did away with (or at least reduced the effect of) Zed Teleporting, which was one of my primary reasons for giving the game a negative rating. Furthermore, they improved Han\\'s\\' intro, along with some of his attacks, visual effects, and other things. This, amongst with countless other improvements, all work spectacularly, with nary a bug in sight. I\\'ve gotta say Tripwire, I\\'m very bloody impressed.'}]},\n",

If you're just starting off I highly reccomend Soldier he is a Great Starting off Character. He has Decent Health and Damage and racist remarks that'll keep you laughing for days! If You want to be The favourite on your team Switch to medic and heal some folks or Equip Blutsauger, Medi-Gun and Bone-saw and just go full on Battle medic. A Great gamode to start off in is Control Point. It shows you how to get around efficently with great big maps. But whatever you do Avoid being seen wearing the gibus at all times unless painted. This has to be the very best F2P game there is. 10/10\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Exelente trabajo, de verdad, este es uno de las primeras novelas visuales que e podido seguir, su etapa inicial a sido muy confusa, pero apesar de todo, fue un buen material para ir escalando gradualmente hacia arriba con tan buen material de 01/10 a 10/10, y por eso RECOMIENDO esta novela visual de corazon, se a ganado sus puntos, por otro lado, buena trama, psicologico, buen humor, entre otras palabras, si entras en el personaje la lectura te llevara hasta donde presisamente tiene el mensaje analitico en forma de obra literaria narrado por el prota, su forma de aplicar el romance en la historia es inusual e indirecto, lo que motiva mas a seguir la novela y de convertirla en una verdadera obra de arte. Esta gran obra me a marcado profundamente, me a hecho sentir una gran fecilidad y por ello siempre estara en mi corazon, por eso les agradesco al autor y a todos aquellos que colaboraron con esta obra, porque no me quedan palabras para describir que esta obra es un gran exito. ¬°GRACIAS!'},\n",

       "    'review': \"   English review :Best documentary about what is e-sports, behaps the focus is only on DotA, show how big is this place. Who says a simple game can be something giant like a mundial tournament.This movie doesn't only for DotA specially but for every single competitive game. Also raise up a great reflection, worth give up of college, family, friends and of live your always-life just for do what you like and be paid for it?Even if you're not a DotA player watch this, worth so much, I honestly don't play but is the second time that I see since was released last year and is amazing the way they retract and show what is e-sports, furthermore is just 1h29min.:D :)   An√°lise em portugu√™s :Melhor document√°rio sobre o que √© e-sports, apesar de o foco ser APENAS no DotA, j√° mostra o qu√£o incr√≠vel √© essa √°rea. Quem diria que um simples jogo pode se transformar em algo grande como um torneio mundial.Esse filme n√£o serve apenas para DotA mas para os jogos competitivos em geral. E tamb√©m levanta uma grande reflex√£o, ser√° que vale a pena deixar os estudos de lado, fam√≠lia, amigos e de viver a sua vida de sempre para fazer o que voc√™ gosta e ser pago por isso?Mesmo que voc√™ n√£o jogue DotA assista esse document√°rio, vale muito a pena, eu n√£o jogo mas √© a segunda vez que assisto desde quando lan√ßou ano passado e √© inacredit√°vel a maneira que eles retratam e o mostram o que s√£o e-sports, al√©m do mais √© apenas 1h29m.:D :)\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Meant to write a review of this ages ago, but steam didn\\'t play ball and deleted it before I could post it. In short - AMAZING FUN GAME!!!Slightly longer - I have been playing this game casually for years, from the original days. Great concept, challenging and the randomness keeps it interesting. The only slight criticism I have, is that the only way to get the random powerups is to enter some obscure \"cheat code\", which i always felt was a massive part of the game originally. However outside of that, I cannot fault the gameplay. Nation red tried to copy this somewhat, but crimsonland is much better executed in my humble opinion.'}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"PROS:- Hats.- Free to play.- Strong community.- Graphics and caricatures.- Bunch of user-generated contents.- Lifetime support and updates confirmed (it is Valve.)CONS:- Hats (sick of them.)- Lack of tribute to id and Quake.- More players means inevitably more kids and toxic players, too (statistically speaking.)Final Remarks:I pre-ordered The Orange Box back in 2007 and I have watched from the start how Team Fortress 2 (TF2) evolved into something perpetual thingy and Valve's flagship of their both economically and experimentally successful multiplayer game (now of course DotA2 and CS:GO have risen to stand along and they all pretty much surpassed it.) Do you realize how monumental this game was (and seemingly still is) to gamers and even to Valve themselves? Steam Achievement and later drop system along with hats were first introduced for TF2. I remember when hat phenomenon was all over the place and everyone wanted Fancy Fedora so much.Here is one fun story about the game; A guy from SourceOP known as Drunken F00l got VAC-banned for making idling tool for TF2 and for cheating an event item known as Golden Wrench. Including him, people who used idling tool got their hats and items taken away meanwhile all other active TF2 players were awarded with Halo hats for not using the tool. But after sometime the ban on the SourceOP guy was lifted and he officially started working at Valve for his TF2 Backpack and something more. Well, that guy had talent and Valve definitely knew about it so they decided to hire him in spite of all violations of user agreements as a Steam user. It reminds me of the FBI hiring a genius financial fraudster and there is even a movie about it. So much drama over TF2, aye? You see, this game just has so many interesting stories to tell.When TF2 switched to F2P model, the community even got bigger and stronger than ever before and it is still growing even after many years have passed. All official updates and endless user-created contents enrich the game; more drops, more hats, more weapons, more maps, more Halloween and holiday events, more updates, more everything, and now skins just like in CS:GO; OMG VOLVO. And its market is being sustained on its own economy. Quite amazing. I personally no longer play this game anymore because I already played enough of it, but it is easily understandable why this game is still one of the most played games on Steam.. RECOMMENDED .\"},\n",

Payday is very challenging and yet at the same time so rewarding; when I finally complete a mission I've been struggling with I feel EPIC. It's very addictive, and the only negative thing I have to say is that I wish there was something to spend all your money on in game, like with Payday 2. I also really like that this game has co-op, I play with my husband and we have a blast. I highly reccomend this game. \"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Unfortunately, the biggest flaw of this game is the one it touts in the opening paragraph; procedural dungeon delving. For those kiddies at home new to roguelikes, it means randomised within programmed constraints.Now, the enviornments look great (despite being skinned similar) when you\\'re fighting your way through it, it feels cool. But the nature of procedural generation is that the clever placement of enemies is impossible in a game like this. I\\'m going to resort to the \"Dark Souls comparison\" thing here, Dark Souls enemies are placed in a genius fashion; they make you take risks and assess your situation. This game just feels like someone had a big box of vikings, giant spiders and robots and went \"WOOPS I dropped them all over my maze, eh, some adventurer will clean them up\". You\\'ll never feel like the enemies are using the environment against you, you\\'ll never look at a group of enemies and think of a way to get past them. The way to get past them is always the same; run at them and mash attack til they die (Optional: Heal afterwards, but you are invincible anyway (more on that below!))Even in a game like Destiny, you\\'re forced to think about what enemy you\\'re fighting, and adjust your tactic. But in Necropolis the tactic for every type of enemy is exactly the same; hit a bunch, dodge to the side, or special attack in groups. There is both not enough enemy types and very little change in how you fight them. Even when there\\'s vikings, wizards, robots, and skeletons all at once, all you do is hit them til they fall down. The only time they ever change is by health amount (to pretty ridiculous levels of grindy health) and minor reskins. Oh yeah, enemies also never ever block or stop you from attacking, SO GO NUTS.It also bugs me to no end that one of the only things you use currency, which is gems, for in this game is to level up (AKA, get more health), but by level 6 (of 9) you are already max level. So what do you spend the rest of your gems on? You don\\'t. You can buy crafting recipes or potions and that\\'s it. You will very soon have 8,000 gems in one playthrough that you literally can\\'t do anything with.For a game with \\'difficult\\' on the tags, I expected this to take more than 3 tries playing solo (in my second try, the game just never gave me an armour drop \\'just cuz\\', so I lost). You have infinite healing items because you can just craft meat to eat, I had somewhere around 50 pieces of meat I could use to craft more healing at the end of the game. And for a game with \\'rogue-like\\' in the title, I expected there to be more randomized RPG elements. There are four tiers of items; the higher the tier, the better the item, no exceptions. The fact that there\\'s so many armour types, but only 4 actual armour classes wastes the potential of all the different sets they hand out. Why not a passive for each armour set? Why, because of the obvious reason; you wouldn\\'t be able to figure out what the passive does without reading the wiki because of the \"I\\'m a smartass\" goofy text that makes almost every item wholly confusing. I get it; the weapons and armour have been kept intentionally simple so you don\\'t sit reading inventory screens for years, but the lack of item variety also effects my willingness to replay it again.The most insulting part about calling it a roguelike is that you are practically invincible! You get a resurrection potion. Yes. A potion where you can keep going when you died. Oh I\\'m sorry, did I say A potion, I meant the ability to craft infinite resurrection potions. Which, again, would be less of a big deal if you didn\\'t have infinite crafting ingredients on you at all times because every enemy spews out craft confetti so you\\'ll never be short on anything but inventory space.I sound a bit salty, because I am. I was really looking forward to this, it had a lot of potential. Do I ever think I\\'ll play it again? No, probably not, unless all my buddies end up with it in a humble or something. For $30, you\\'re half way to the 40 hour long Dark Souls 3, not to mention all the other roguelikes that you can get for half that price, which offer a lot more content. Sorry guys; it was a good attempt but fell short of what it could\\'ve been.'}]},\n",

       "    'review': \"Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.First of all, some history.All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.Here's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.Here's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies.Sign up to play here: http://www.thezombieinfection.com/Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialThanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!Frank\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Okay, so I\\'m hearing you ask \"Why should I buy Garry\\'s Mod?\" Well, you\\'d find that a silly question too if you\\'d been through the same experience some of us have been.And now, I just want to say, the reason I\\'m writing this review is because it\\'s one of my favourite games. My favourite, probably. But I also want you to know I could say \"I recommend this game, it\\'s awesome\" and be done with it. But that\\'s not what makes you want to buy a game.So, first off, a history lesson. Garry\\'s Mod started off as a mod for Half Life 2. You play through standard Half Life 2, whilist spawning in whacky inventions to help you along the way. It\\'s so much more than that now.It still runs off the same Half Life 2 game engine, like CS:S and TF2 do. I guess it would be classified an FPS sandbox game. But you can change that.You can spawn in classic Half Life 2 props, weapons, entities, npcs, spawn in other peoples creations, go into other people\\'s worlds, try out some other classic gamemodes like Jailbreak, Trouble in Terrorist Town or DarkRP.There are also lots of things that aren\\'t from the Half Life 2 game in sandbox. Tools. Weld, duplicate, face posing, weight and so many more.What\\'s that you say? You want more? We can handle that too. This is where the game really shines. Addons. If you go onto the main menu, they\\'ll be a tab called \\'Addons\\'. This is where you can keep all of other players, and you\\'re own creations and mods. Modern Weapons, cars, nuclear missiles! Without addons, you would only have standard sandbox. All gamemodes, such as Melonbomber, TTT, HL2RP, Zombie Survival etc. couldn\\'t exist without addons!Some textures and props you can\\'t get through addons which is understandable for this kind of sandbox game. For CS:S props, you need CS:S. There\\'s DOD, TF2, L4D, HL, DH, etc. Once you have these mounted, (main menu, click the game controller, and tick the boxes in the list) just go into your singleplayer sandbox, and there, in the main props list, will be the ragdolls, props etc. from the games.I reckon this pretty much concludes my very brief review of the game that is Garry\\'s Mod. All the rest... that\\'s for you to find out.Over \\'n\\' out,-Frank'},\n",

I love looking at them.It features very functional turrets (manned/unmanned), and a great cover system.It also features an array of game modes and a huge community for you to play with.I know that's not much to go on, but trust me, it's a great mod, and it's free!All it requires (I think) is that you own a source game (That worked for me, anyway).Frank\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"The Zeus DLC for Arma 3 is, in my opinion, better than any other DLC or mod.Basically, if you go into the Editor, and you place some things, setup a little scenario for a few guys to play, that's all well and good. Although, if you want to make a much more enjoyable experience for yourself and the players, or if you think the editor is too fiddly and hard to use, use Zeus.Zeus allows you to use the default editor, but in 3D, with easier to use placement and editing panels. Also, you can change things while players are  in game.  Brilliant.It's very hard to explain something so amazing in word form, so check out the video below to get a better grasp on Zeus.www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR_TN_XiZNEAlso, make sure you check out the official Arma 3 Channel.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialI hope my brief review has somewhat helped you, go enjoy it yourself!\"}]},\n",

       "    'review': 'StarForge is a game with big ambitions but offers little fun whatsoever. It is true that people buying star forge should consider the fact it is in alpha but that being said, the game itself is barely in a playable state. The world\\'s are dull and lifeless, lacking any sort of explorability past the opening area despite the game advertising \"procedural voxel terrain\". The game is set on the premise of a survival game in which enemies come in waves. This sounds pretty standard in theory and seems like an easy basis for a game but StarForge manages to get it all wrong. The waves are slow and tedious, the enemies lack variety and any sort of intelligent A.I and the weapons are dreadful. I have never played a game with gun mechanics as bad as StarForge, they\\'re just dreadful.The enemies have basic animations which don\\'t show when it is actually in a state of death so you are often left shooting the enemy for prolonged periods of time as the fact is, the enemies animations don\\'t show life even when it should be living. You control horrendously in StarForge. Moving, one of the simplest of tasks, is made hard by sluggish movement and bad mouse control. The saturation of motion blur is almost sickening and the lack of any choice to turn it off just makes it even worst. StarForge however does one thing interesting with the movement which is in the form of ragdoll-esque falling. It can provide some laughs as you fly into objects and spaz the hell out when falling but is anything but a good gameplay feature and more of a humerous addition. The games building is a clunky system which like most of the games systems works great in theory but fails to pratically work.  The simple idea of cube-based building is ruined by the games approach to the building system as well as a lack of world modification which seems like something the game needed from the start. StarForge makes a lot of promises and doesn\\'t deliver on any of them to the point where writing this review felt more like a winge as I could not think of one thing I liked about the game. One can only hope that in future updates the game gains some sort of solidity but the fact of the matter is that StarForge isn\\'t playable by any stretch of the imagination and a lot of work will need to be put in to give it\\'s buyers a reason to enjoy it.'}]},\n",

I really, really enjoyed this game and had a few moments where I was profoundly touched and moved by the experience. It can be completed in 3 hours if you really rush the story, which is mostly linear but each area is very beautiful and teeming with plants and aquatic life to explore. There's no dialogue and the story is vague/open to interpretation, which I feel makes it more of an indie title that a lot of people will feel is pretentious and style over substance. That being said, I personally feel this title is genuine and I loved all aspects of it. A very relaxing and gorgeous experience -- dim your lights, calm your mind and get lost beneath the waves.\"},\n",

Clearly alot of work is yet to be done and everything they add will hopefully work with the game and make it more balanced than it is at this time. But so far i've been impressed with how good the AI is, how smooth the game runs and how smooth the animations are (theres even birds that fly onto your arm time to time) plus crafting and item collecting is simple, just watch out for the tribal patrols. If u've got the $15 and you enjoy survival with a touch of horror u will enjoy this awesome alphaps. personally I haven't encounted any bad AI but I have heard some people have been having trouble with em\"},\n",

My FPS in Scholar was constantly 60, yet in DS3, it drops down to less than 10, depending on where I'm looking!DS3 even auto calibrated my settings to high, indicating that I SHOULD be able to run the game effectively at those settings, yet the game still suffers terribly. Even when all of the settings are changed to LOW, the performance doesn't change! This means that there are serious problems originating from the developers, and that they must be fixed before you consider purchasing this game.Stay clear for now.\"},\n",

Why show Ship enthusiasts one thing and then when you get it, it\\'s not as amazing as the screenshots. It\\'s quite under-developed. Sure the enviroment like the water looks better-ish but the same simple an basic ship simulation is in place, there is no complexity in this simulator. Some boats are missing sounds still. Worste of all VSTEP are truly control-live of this simulator, we cannot add our own mods to it, it\\'s VSTEP or no improvement.
